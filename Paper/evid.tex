  Lines at the polls can precipitate unequal treatment of voters if
  some voters are compelled to wait longer than others before casting
  their ballots. In addition, by raising the cost of voting, long
  lines may influence the willingness of eligible voters to
  participate in elections.  We leverage early in-person voter

  find fewer problems in 2016 compared to 2012. Florida
  early in-person voters who waited excessively in 2012 had a slightly
  lower probability---approximately one percent---of turning out to
  vote in 2016, \emph{ceteris paribus}, and they also had slightly
  lower turnout probabilities in the 2014 General Election.  Our

\section*{Introduction}

Modern democracies are characterized by regular and free elections,
the legitimacy of which can suffer in the face of perceptions of
unfairness and disparate treatment of groups of voters
\citep{norris2014electoral}.  An election can fail to treat all voters
equally if, for example, there are meaningful differences in vote
tabulating technologies across the electorate
\citep[e.g.,][]{kimballkropf:tech}; if some groups of voters must
contend with registration hurdles that others do not
\cite[e.g.,][]{ansolhersh:registration}; if some voters face strict
photo identification requirements and others no such requirements
\citep[e.g.,][]{benteleetal:newjimcrow}; and, if some voters have to
travel much longer distances than others to cast their ballots
\citep[e.g.,][]{dyckgimpel:distance}.  More generally, when in a given
election the \emph{cost of voting} in the sense of
\cite{downs:econtheory} varies significantly by voter group---where
group membership could be based on race/ethnicity or party
affiliation, for example---the principle of equal treatment of voters
is at risk.

%   Elections affected by fraud certainly fall in this
% category, as \citet{cottrelletal:fraud2016} argue, and elections
% conducted in the midst of acrimonious debates over the nature of the
% franchise risk being thought of as unfair \citet{hasen:votingwars}.
% Fairness can also be in the eye of the beholder:
% \citet{sancesstewart:confidence} show how confidence in a given
% election outcome can be a function of whether an individual's
% preferred candidate won.

Here we consider how voting lines, an aspect of election
administration, are related to equal treatment.  The lines that
develop outside a polling station reflect administrative decisions
about resource allocation as well as the extent of voter turnout
\citep{herronsmith:hanoverstudy}.  If lines adversely affect some
voters more than others, then the cost of voting will vary across
voters.  Thus, any assessment of the extent to which a given election
featured equal treatment of voters must include an analysis of voting
lines and whether certain groups of individuals waited in line longer
than others.

Voting lines are potential issues wherever voters cast their ballots
\emph{in-person}, as opposed to voting remotely via mail.  The vast
majority---over 75 percent in 2016 and approximately 66 percent in
2012---of voters in the United States who cast ballots in presidential
elections do so in-person, either on an Election Day itself or during
a corresponding early voting period whose duration depends on relevant
local laws.\footnote{For the composition of the 2012 and 2016
  electorates, see \citet{eac:2012} and \citet{eac:2016},
  respectively.}  As of this writing of this paper, there only three
states---Colorado, Oregon, and Washington---in which almost every
ballot is cast via mail.\footnote{See ``EAVS DEEP DIVE: EARLY,
  ABSENTEE AND MAIL VOTING,'' United States Election Assistance
  Commission, October 17, 2017, available at
  \url{https://www.eac.gov/documents/2017/10/17/eavs-deep-dive-early-absentee-and-mail-voting-data-statutory-overview}
  (last accessed September 13, 2018).}

%  In-person voting experiences have a number of
% features that are distinct from the experiences of those who vote by
% mail, and our interest here is the act of waiting in line.

% Casting an in-person ballot requires traveling to
% a voting precinct; possibly spending time in a line prior to voting;
% authenticating oneself in some fashion to election officials;
% physically registering candidate and ballot measure preferences; and,
% submitting a ballot for tabulation.  

%% 2016 EAC is from p. 10
%% really think we need to stick with polling station terminology, not precincts, as early voting is not precinct-based.

Our analysis considers two features of voting lines, by which we mean
lines that form in front of polling stations as opposed to lines in
which voters, already in the act of casting ballots, are forced to
stand. First, waiting in line to vote constitutes a time tax
\citep{mukherjee:timetax}. This tax can be negligible---for example, a
voter waits a scant number of seconds prior to initiating her voting
process---or imposing---some of the Florida voters we describe shortly
waited several hours to vote in 2012. Associated with a voting line
time tax are the distributional questions associated with all forms of
taxation: is the time tax fair and, in particular, is the burden of
this tax spread uniformly across voters or concentrated on selected
groups?

Second, waiting in line is an experience that may have ``downstream''
electoral effects, as characterized by
\citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}. When an individual is
compelled to pay a relatively high tax in order to participate in a
social or political activity, a natural response might be to avoid the
activity, or substitute for it, in the future.  If voting lines
operate in this fashion, then they will effectively depress voter
turnout.  And if lines affect some voter groups more than others, then
their associated depressive effect on turnout will not burden all
voters equally.  Unequal burdens notwithstanding, given the relatively
low rate of voter participation in American presidential
elections---approximately 58 percent in 2012 and 60 percent in
2016---any aspect of the voting experience that might have a
depressive effect on turnout should be considered a matter worthy of
study.\footnote{The national turnout rate for a general election
  depends on the way that the number of eligible voters in the country
  is calculated.  The figures cited here are from the United States
  Election Project, available at
  \url{http://www.electproject.org/home} (last accessed December 11,
  2017).\label{fn:uselectionproject}}

% To make matters
% concrete, if a line in front of a particular restaurant is long, some
% individuals may substitute an alternative eatery for the restaurant in
% question, one without an imposing line, or even forego
% eating.\footnote{Alternatively, a line in front of a restaurant might
%   be a quality signal, in which case the presence of a line might be
%   an incentive to wait in it.  The same could be said for voting, and
%   here we ignore the possibility that lines form due to potential
%   voters using the presence of lines as a means to gather information
%   on whether voting is valuable.}

%  While it is not
% \emph{a priori} clear that voting can be substituted for in the way
% that selecting a restaurant might be, we should not dismiss outright
% the possibility that the effect of waiting in line to vote, which as
% we have already argued raises the cost of voting, might decrease the
% likelihood of voting in the future.  


These two features of voting lines---time tax and potential downstream
participatory consequences---are conceptually distinct. The time tax
for voting could be uniformly spread across voters, which might be
normatively pleasing in the sense of not violating equal treatment of
voters, and yet there could be a significant effect of waiting in line
on future electoral participation. Or, the time tax could be
concentrated on certain voters group, which most would argue violate
equal treatment regardless of whether there are downstream
consequences of waiting to vote. With this in mind, our empirical
analysis of voting lines during early in-person voting in Florida is
divided into two sections. First, we assess which voters are more
likely to wait in line. Second, we consider whether individuals who
wait excessively to vote are less likely to vote in a subsequent
election.

% One of the difficulties in studying voting lines in the United States
% is data availability: it is not easy to determine precisely how long
% voters waited in line at the polls.  It is accordingly difficult to
% study if there are consequences for subsequent voting behavior of
% waiting in line.  Some researchers have dealt with this hurdle by
% using surveys---either Election Day exit polls or post-election
% questionnaires---which integrate responses to waiting time questions
% with other survey items, namely socioeconomic and partisan queries
% \citep{stewart:waitingtovote2012}.  Post-election surveys on voting
% experiences can foster access to wide swaths of voters, and this is
% valuable.  A limitation of surveys regarding electoral experiences,
% though, is that they rely on self-reports of wait times, which may not
% be accurate, and in addition it is known that self-reporting of
% turnout in general can suffer from over-reporting
% \citep{karpbrockington:overreport,bellietal:overreport}.

%In light of potential concern with survey-based evidence on voting
%lines,

In contrast to much of the literature on voting lines, which relies on
surveys, we turn here to a relatively untapped source of electoral
information, namely, voter check-in times collected by Florida
counties that recorded check-ins from early voting sites in the 2012
and 2016 General Elections.  The hundreds of thousands of check-in
times which form the basis of our results are not subject to potential
biases arising in self-reports of time spent in line.  Moreover, we
can associate a voter's check-in time with her race/ethnicity, party
registration, and history of electoral participation, pieces of
information publicly available in Florida's statewide voter file.  Our
use of early voting check-in times complements the literature's heavy
use of survey results.

% Still, in the interests
% of being transparent about limitations in our research design, a
% voter's check-in time is not directly connected to the amount of time
% she spent waiting in line.  We describe below how we link voter
% check-in times with corresponding waiting times, but the connection is
% not perfect.

Regarding the time tax associated with waiting to vote, we find
disproportionate concentration of this tax on minority voters.  The
situation was worse in Florida in 2012 than in 2016, and in general
our collection of check-in times highlights fewer troubling issues in
the more recent election.  This is consistent with national, survey-based
evidence on voting lines in the 2012 and 2016 General
Elections.\footnote{For a national 2012 versus 2016 comparison, see
  \url{http://electionupdates.caltech.edu/2016/12/14/this-just-in-lines-at-the-polls-shorter-in-2016-than-in-2012}
  (last accessed March 30, 2017), as well as
  \url{http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/fortier-and-palmer-column-who-waits-the-longest-to-vote/article_81efabad-aa23-577b-83d1-0e524cf844ef.html}
  (last accessed June 30, 2017).}  Whether the recent decrease in
waiting times reflects progress in Florida election administration,
substitution effects and voter sorting, or idiosyncrasies from either
the 2012 or 2016 General Election is not clear.  Two election-years of
data are unlikely to be sufficient to gauge broad progress in a state
as large and heterogeneous as Florida.

Regarding the effect of waiting to vote on future electoral
participation, conditional on our strategy for identifying those
Florida early voters who suffered long waits in 2012, we find small
yet negative consequences for turnout in 2016.  As a consistency check
on our results that rely on presidential election years, we find
similar effects of waiting in line in 2012 on turnout in the midterm
elections of 2014.  The consequences of excessive line waiting on
turnout are not negligible insofar as long lines do appear to be
associated with lower participation levels.  These consequences are,
however, small, around one percent, and this is consistent with
\citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}.  We show as well that
early voters in 2012 were less likely to vote early in 2016,
\emph{ceteris paribus}; in particular, early voters who voted early or
late in a day of early voting in 2012 were particularly less likely to
vote early in 2016.

The next section situates our study in the literature on voting lines
and election administration.  We then turn to early voting check-in
times in Florida and explain what these times mean and how they can be
interpreted.  Our empirical results on lines are divided into two
sections: first we describe the distribution of the voting time tax
across our set of Florida voters, and second we analyze the downstream
effects of the tax.  We conclude with observations about congestion at
the polls and equal treatment of voters.

\section*{Voting lines and equal treatment in American elections}

Voting is a fundamental right in the United States.  Exercising this
right entails costs, as discussed by \cite{downs:econtheory} in his
formulation of the calculus of voting, and an excessively high cost of
voting can diminish the meaning of the right to vote.  As the United
States Supreme Court ruled in \emph{Reynolds v.\ Sims} (1964), ``[T]he
right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the
weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly
prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.''\footnote{See
  \url{https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html}
  (last accessed December 12, 2017) for the text of the decision.}

In assessing the costs of voting that may debase or dilute the right
to cast a ballot, the Supreme Court has considered the fairness of an
assortment of election-related rules adopted by states.  These include
rules relating to redistricting (\emph{Shaw v.\ Reno} (1993)),
literacy tests (\emph{Oregon v.\ Mitchell} (1970)), proof of
citizenship (\emph{Arizona v.\ Inter Tribal Council of Arizona}
(2012)), voter identification (\emph{Crawford v.\ Marion County
  Election Board} (2008)), and the purging of registered voters
(\emph{Husted v.\ A.\ Philip Randolph Institute} (2018)). In various
cases, the Court has been asked to balance state interests with the
equal treatment of voters.  Although there is ample evidence that long
voting lines in Florida in the 2012 General Election
disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities
\citep{herron_smith2014}, as of yet the Supreme Court has not been
asked to rule on whether Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act applies to
excessively long wait times at the polls, which in principle might
constitute ``a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of
the United States to vote on account of race or color'' (52 U.S.C.\ \S
10301(a)).

A lack of Court attention notwithstanding, long voting lines have
received considerable attention in the last several election cycles in
the United States.  ``To me,'' Cynthia Perez complained in March 2016
after seeing a long line wending its way around an early voting center
in Maricopa County, Arizona, with those in line reporting standing in
line for more than three hours before checking in to vote, ``this is
not what democracy is about.''\footnote{This quote is drawn from
  ``Angry Arizona Voters Demand: Why Such Long Lines at Polling
  Sites?'' \emph{The New York Times}, March 24, 2016, available at
  \url{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/us/angry-arizona-voters-demand-why-such-long-lines-at-polling-sites.html}
  (last accessed December 15, 2017)} Ahead of her state's 2016
presidential primary, election administrators in Maricopa County (over
four million residents and one of the largest counties in the United
States) had cut the number of Election Day polling places by roughly
70 percent, increasing the strain on early voting
centers.\footnote{According to the 2012-2016 American Community
  Survey, 5-Year Estimates, the population of Maricopa County is
  4,088,549.}  Voters in a handful of states also experienced long
lines in the 2016 General Election, but their experiences were largely
mild compared to what transpired four years prior in
Florida.\footnote{On various states with line issues in 2016, see
  ``Why Long Voting Lines Could Have Long-Term Consequences,''
  \emph{The New York Times}, November 8, 2016, available at
  \url{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/upshot/why-long-voting-lines-today-could-have-long-term-consequences.html}
  (last accessed December 9, 2017).  On Georgia in particular, see
  ``Early voting lines are so long, people are fainting. That harms
  democracy,'' \emph{The Guardian}, October 19, 2016,
  \url{https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/early-voting-lines-georgia}
  (last accessed December 9, 2017).}  In 2011, the Florida state
legislature curtailed the state's early voting period, which, as some
observers had expected, resulted in long lines for many electors who
tried to vote in person during the truncated early voting period in
the 2012 General Election \citep{herron_smith2014}.  Following the
election and the seemingly inevitable anger over long waits at the
polls, then-United States President Barack Obama formed a Presidential
Commission in early 2013 to address general election administrative
issues in the United States.  In doing so, he highlighted the plight
of 102-year old Desiline Victor, a Haitian-American woman who on
October 27, 2012, waited in line for nearly four hours at Florida's
North Miami Public Library early voting center.  Obama's Presidential
Commission devoted some of its January 2014, report to long lines,
concluding that, ``[A]s a general rule, no voter should have to wait
more than half an hour in order to have an opportunity to vote''
\citep[p.\ 13,][]{pcea:2014}.\footnote{The executive order creating
  this commission is available at

\subsection*{Survey-based research on voting lines}

These anecdotes above are striking and raise questions about voting
lines in general---in particular, how long they tend to be and which
voters have to wait in them, how much variance there is across
jurisdictions in waiting times, and what consequences lines have, if
any, beyond the cost of standing in line.  With few exceptions
\citep[e.g.,][]{spencermarkovits:renege, herronsmith:hanoverstudy,
  pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}, much of what we know about
wait times for voters is derived from survey data. Most notably,
\citet{stewart:waitingtovote2012} and his coauthors have conducted
post-election, Internet-based surveys in the United States following
the last three general elections.  These surveys query voters about
their experiences at the polls, and the surveys include items on
estimated wait times.  \citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012}'s
\emph{Survey of the Performance of American Elections} (SPAE), which
surveys 200 individuals in each state and Washington, D.C., along with
the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), have been used to
gauge relative wait times across states the as well as overall wait
times for different sub-populations of voters.  According to
\citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012}, wait times across the United
States vary considerably, but a state's average wait time tends to be
consistent over time.

Surveys relying on self-reported wait times can serve as valuable
barometers for gauging both individual-level and regional
distributions of voting delays.  For example, Floridians have for a
decade consistently reported having to endure some of the longest wait
times in the country. In the 2012 General Election, in-person voters
in Florida reported on average waiting 39 minutes to cast a ballot,
three times the national average \citep{stewart:waitingtovote2012}.
Surveys like the SPAE can help identify when during the voting process
wait times are most likely to occur.  In the 2012 General Election,
\citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012} documented that over
three-fifths of early in-person voters nationwide who reported waiting
in line to vote said their wait was primarily during the check-in
stage.

Surveys are also helpful when trying to tease out the possibility of
differential voting line time taxes across sub-populations of voters.
Drawing on 2008 CCES data, \cite{mukherjee:timetax} finds minority
voters were more likely, relative to white voters, to pay such a tax
when queuing to vote. \citet{kimball:voting}, using the 2012 SPAE,
reports that voters in urban areas faced longer lines than rural
voters, and \citet{pettigrew:racegapwaittimes} estimates that
typically non-white voting locations in the United States were
associated with voter wait times approximately twice as long as those
in white locations.  \cite{herron:confidence} use exit polls in
Miami-Dade in 2014 to gauge the polling place experiences of voters
leaving polling stations.  In his study of the 2012 General Election,
which builds on the 2008 General Election research design of
\citet{alvarez:survey}, \cite{stewart:waitingtovote2012} finds that a
voter's race/ethnicity is an important ``individual-level
demographic'' that explains disparate wait times.  ``African Americans
waited an average of 23 minutes to vote,''
\citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012} found, ``compared to only 12
minutes for Whites; Hispanics reported waiting 19 minutes, on
average.''  \citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012} concludes that
these differences in wait times could be ``due to factors associated
with where minority voters live, rather than with minority voters as
individuals'' (pp.\ 457-458).

There are several limitations associated with the use of survey
results to estimate voter wait times at the polls. First, surveys by
construction draw on voter self-reports.  There are a variety of
reasons that respondents might not recall accurately how long they
waited in line before voting \citep[e.g.,][]{sackettetal:timeflies},
and social desirability may confound accurate reporting on turnout,
leading to overreporting \citep{ansolhersh:bigdata}.  Second, surveys
often do not distinguish among the various wait times that in-person
voters can experience when parking, queuing up to check-in, filling
out ballots, or processing completed ballots. Third, not all surveys
have access to tens of thousands of respondents.  Given variability
across states and even local jurisdictions in election administration
practices, national surveys may not be not particularly well-suited
for assessing variation in wait times across types of voters and
polling places within a state.

\subsection*{An alternative to voter line surveys}

In light of limitations with survey data, our approach to voting lines
draws on an alternative source of information: observed check-in times
of voters in Florida who cast their ballots at early in-person polling
sites prior to the 2012 and 2016 General Elections.  We explain below
precisely what we mean by a check-in time, but for the moment we note
that, in 2016, more Florida voters---3.88 million---cast early
in-person ballots than voters who mailed in their absentee ballots
(2.76 million) or who voted in person at their local Election Day
precincts (2.96 million) \citep{FDOS:2016vote}.  The
prevalence--represented by millions of individuals--of early in-person
voting is not unique to Florida. Across the United States, early
voting is increasingly popular, and for analyses of early voting
reforms and their consequences see
\citet{neelyrichardson:earlyvoting}, \citet{gronkebaum:growth},
\citet{gronketoffey:psychological}, \citet{gronke:2012}, and
\citet{burdenetal:unanticipated}.

% \citet{gronke:earlyvotingreforms},


% Although there are debates in the
% literature about the extent to which early voting has changed the
% electorate, if at all, here we take this mode of voting as given.

Florida notwithstanding, there is good reason to focus on wait times
during early in-person voting.  Michael P.\ McDonald, on his Election
Project website, estimates that over 23 million voters cast early
in-person ballots in ``advance'' of the November 8, 2016, General
Election, some 17 percent of the 137 million votes
cast.\footnote{These numbers are drawn from the United States Election
  Project; see fn.\ \ref{fn:uselectionproject}.}  If one were to be
concerned that our focus on early voters in Florida limits our scope,
these statistics imply that our results apply to millions of
Americans.

In terms of our use of Florida voting data \emph{per se}, this state's
open records laws make the state an excellent laboratory for the study
of election administration. For example, in their study of congestion
at the polls in Florida in the 2012 General Election,
\cite{herronsmith:closingtimes} use precinct-level data detailing when
the last voter in a precinct checked-in to vote in a study showing
significant differences in the closing times of precincts within
counties, contingent on a precinct's racial and ethnic
composition. Florida's laws also provide a wealth of information not
only about who votes, but when and how voters cast ballots.  Drawing
on publicly available voter demographic and voter history data in
Florida, \cite{shinosmith:registrationtiming} demonstrate that voters
who register to vote immediately prior to a registration deadline are
more likely to turn out in a proximate general election, but not in
subsequent elections, and \cite{amos_etal2017} find differences in
individual-level turnout across political party and racial and ethnic
categories among registered voters whose precincts were eliminated or
relocated by local election administrators.  Similarly, by linking
multiple statewide voter files and individual-level early voting
files, \cite{herron_smith2014} demonstrate how reductions in the
number of early voting days following the 2008 General Election were
associated with a drop in early voting in 2012, especially among
minority voters who had cast ballots on the final Sunday of early
voting in 2008.

%, a day of early voting that was eliminated by the state legislature ahead of the 2012 election.

While Florida's open records laws facilitate election administration
scholarship, when it comes to direct election monitoring, Florida
grants considerable privacy to voters.  Namely, with the exception of
those serving as candidate, political party, or ballot issue
representatives, state law prohibits precinct observers from tracking
voting processes inside a polling place when votes are actively being
cast. This effectively precludes scholars who want to understand why
lines form in front or inside Florida precincts from replicating
observational studies of voter activities in the vein of
\possessivecite{spencermarkovits:renege} study of California and
\possessivecite{herronsmith:hanoverstudy} research on New Hampshire.

\section*{Florida early voting check-in times}

Election administration in the Florida---from registering voters, to
determining precinct sizes, to staffing and locating polling places,
and to setting early voting days and hours---is largely controlled at
the county level within a framework established by the Florida state
legislature. Our early voting check-in times are thus gleaned from
Florida counties.\footnote{We made public records requests to
  individual Florida county Supervisors of Elections, and the data we
  use in this paper is based on these requests.  Most counties that we
  contacted were not able to provide us with early voter check-in
  times.}

% , and these times cover check-ins
% across a variety of early voting stations during the 2012 and 2016
% General Elections.  

A Florida voter who wishes to cast his or her ballot early may vote at
any early voting polling location in the county in which he or she is
registered.  This is distinct from in-person, Election Day voting,
during which a registered Florida voter may vote only at his or her
assigned precinct.  This flexibility necessitates that a county track
its early voters.  Rather than relying on traditional, paper-based
pollbooks to check in these individuals, as is the case for Election
Day in many Florida counties, the 67 county Supervisors of Elections
in Florida use electronic pollbooks to check in voters during the
state's early voting period.  These pollbooks are for the most part
known as Electronic Voter iDentification machines, or EViDs for short.
Although there is variance across Florida counties in electronic
pollbook implementation, for simplicity we refer to all electronic
pollbooks as EViD machines.\footnote{For example, Sarasota County uses
  a different electronic voting system for its early voters (source
  for this is a phone call with Cathy Fowler, office of the Sarasota
  Supervisor of Elections, on March 31, 2017).}

%% Cathy Fowler:  cfowler@sarasotavotes.com

EViD machines allow county pollworkers to check-in and verify the
registration statuses and identities of Floridians casting early,
in-person ballots. The EViD system is designed to reduce the time it
takes to process early voters, and it fosters synchronization across a
county's early voting centers (important because, as just noted, early
voters in Florida can choose where to cast their ballots) as well as
with the Florida statewide voter database.  For our purposes, EViD
machines record the check-in times for all early voters, and this
provides us with timestamps that specify when a voter began his or her
voting process. EViD timestamps are recorded to the minute, and using
these timestamps we can, for example, identify early voters who had
not checked-in when polls closed at 7:00pm on a given day of early
voting but nonetheless cast ballots.  Per Florida state law, any
elector in line at 7:00pm is allowed to cast a ballot.\footnote{See
  ``The 2017 Florida Statutes,'' Title IX ELECTORS AND ELECTIONS,
  Chapter 100, Section 100.011, available at
  \url{http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App\_mode=Display\_Statute\&Search\_String=\&URL=0100-0199/0100/Sections/0100.011.html}
  (last accessed December 15, 2017).}

We have EViD check-in times from six Florida counties, Alachua,
Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, and Palm Beach, and Table
\ref{tab:evidcounts} lists corresponding numbers of EViD timestamps.
In the 2012 General Election, there were 2,409,097 total early ballots
cast in Florida, and in 2016, 3,876,753 early ballots.\footnote{2012
  General Election turnout statistics are located at
  \url{http://dos.myflorida.com/media/693340/2012ballotscast.pdf}
  (last accessed December 10, 2017), and comparable 2016 General

  \url{http://dos.myflorida.com/media/697842/2016-ge-summaries-ballots-by-type-activity.pdf}
  (last accessed December 10, 2017).}  Our EViD data thus cover
approximately 39 percent and 44 percent of total ballots cast in
Florida in the 2012 and 2016 General Elections,
respectively.\footnote{The numbers in Table \ref{tab:evidcounts} do
  not include 115 EViD check-in times (28 from 2012 and 87 from 2016)
  that are listed as midnight.  We are suspicious that these times are
  not accurate and hence drop them.  Given the total number of EViD
  votes cast, dropping 115 cases is negligible.\label{fn:midnight}}

EViD timestamps, one per early voter, are not subject to potential
self-reporting biases and hence are presumably more accurate than
surveys of voter times or even within-polling place observations of
when voters checked-in.  Moreover, EViD timestamps as associated with
official Florida voter identification numbers, which we can link to
the nearly 14 million individual voter registration records in
Florida's statewide voter file.  To this end, we merge our EViD
timestamps with statewide voter files that cover the 2012 and 2016
General Elections.\footnote{Per Table \ref{tab:evidcounts}, we
  recorded 942,166 early voters across our six counties in 2012 and
  1,687,217 early voters in 2016.  Of those 2012 early voters, 40,455
  could not be matched to the registration records we have from the
  January 2014 statewide Florida voter extract file.  Of the 2016
  early voters, 969 could not be matched to the registration records
  we have from the January 2016 statewide Florida voter extract file.
  In any analysis that uses demographic or partisan information about
  the voters, we drop those voters who could not be matched to
  registration records.}

In 2012, all 67 of Florida's counties offered between six and 12 daily
hours of early voting over an eight-day period (Saturday through
Saturday) that ended immediately prior to the General Election,
November 6, 2012.  In 2016, after long-lines in 2012 had apparently
convinced the state legislature to grant counties more flexibility in
offering early voting opportunities, counties were permitted to offer
up to 12 hours of early voting per day, spread over 14 days, ending
the final Sunday before the November 8, 2016, General Election.
Counties were permitted to offer a maximum of 168 total hours of early
voting.\footnote{See Florida Governor Rick Scott's statement, issued
  in the aftermath of the 2012 General Election, available at
  \url{http://www.flgov.com/2013/01/17/governor-rick-scott-statement-on-election-reforms/}
  (last accessed March 31, 2017).}

Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} displays the distribution of EViD check-in
times on the last Saturday (November 3) of the 2012 General Election
early voting period in two different polling locations in Florida, one
at the Fred B.\ Karl County Center in Hillsborough County and the
other at the West Kendall Regional Library in Miami-Dade County.  The
histograms in this figure describe in ten minute blocks the number of
voters who checked into these two polling stations.  The counts begin
with the first voter who checked-in just as polls opened at 7:00am,
and they end with the last voter who checked-in.

    \caption{West Kendall Regional Library, Miami-Dade County}
    \label{fig:kendallexample}
  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Several features of Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} are notable.  First,
both panels in the figure contain vertical black lines at 7:00pm.
This is the time beyond which additional voters were not allowed to
join a (possibly existing) voting line.  In the Hillsborough County
location (Figure \ref{fig:karlexample}), no check-ins occurred after
7:00pm, and from this it follows that, at 7:00pm, where was no voting
line.  In contrast, the Miami-Dade location (Figure
\ref{fig:kendallexample}) had many post-7:00pm check-ins, the last one
of which occurred around 1:00am on Sunday, November 4.  We thus know
that the last-voting voter at West Kendall Regional Library waited at
least almost six hours to vote.

Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} incorporates via bar shading information
on voter self-reported race/ethnicity.  Early voters at the Fred B.\
Karl County Center were primarily white, although there were periods
on November 3 when the fraction of non-white voters was
disproportionately high, e.g., toward the end of the day.  At the West
Kendall Regional Library, though, the vast majority of early voters
were non-white.  The fraction of non-white voters appears plausibly
consistent across November 3.

Lastly, and very roughly speaking, we observe a flatter or
more-uniform distribution of check-in times at Karl County Center than
in West Kendall Library.  We will draw on this fact later, when we try
to determine which early voters in our six counties waited in line,
and here we provide some intuition.  As illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:tenminhist}, it appears that early voting locations in
Florida that shut down very late had flatter distributions of check-in
times.  We suspect that this is evidence of persistent lines.  In
contrast, the non-uniformity of check-in times that we observe in
Figure \ref{fig:karlexample} is consistent with more of an ebb and
flow of early voters.  We know that there was not a line to vote at
Karl County Center at 7:00pm on Saturday, November 3, this despite the
fact that, per check-in times, the Center was regularly processing
voters.

Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} highlights the value of EViD check-in
times as well as a notable limitation: check-in times are not linked
to arrival times.  All data sources have advantages and disadvantages,
and in the results that follow we draw on the former and attempt to
work with the latter.

\section*{Results}

We present results in two sections.  First, we describe patterns in
check-in times across the 2012 and 2016 General Elections with
particular attention to race/ethnicity and partisanship.  Second we
consider the consequences of extensive early voting wait times.

% based
% on a identifying assumption we use to characterize individuals who
% waited in line before voting.

\subsection*{Who waits?}

Our analysis of who waits to vote turns in large part on check-in
times that occurred \emph{after} 7:00pm on a day of early voting.  Any
voter with such a late check-in must have waited to vote.

\subsubsection*{Early voting in 2012}

Across our six Florida counties of interest, there were 78 early
voting stations in 2012.  These serviced a total of 942,166 voters in
the eight day long, 2012 early voting period.\footnote{This ignores
  the small number of EViD check-in times that look suspicious to us;
  see fn.\ \ref{fn:midnight}.  In addition, early voting locations in
  2012 where two or fewer individuals recorded votes were dropped from
  our analysis.  The EViD data from Orange County and Palm Beach
  County in 2012 and 2016, from Miami-Dade County in 2016, and from
  Broward County in 2016 were not accompanied with voting locations
  for each early voter.  To determine the location at which these
  voters case their ballots, we match their voterids to a masterfile
  in Florida that records the location of every
  vote.}  % XXX fix masterfile

    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{number_of_Locations.pdf}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2012} describes by day of early voting and by
hourly window the number of locations across our six counties that
actively served voters.  All locations served early voters virtually
the entire day, and this is evident in the flat line, for the most
part pegged a bit under 80 prior to 7:00pm, at the top of the figure.
The sole exception to this rule occurred at the earliest time of the
day, during which several early voting stations did not have any
active voters.

After 7:00pm (note the vertical black line at this time), Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2012} shows that check-in uniformity across early
voting locations quickly changed.  On initial days within Florida's
eight-day long early voting period, there was a steep drop in active
locations starting at 7:00pm.  Even with this drop, however, there
were still at least five open locations at 9:00pm on every day of
early voting.  Then, on the last two days of early voting, November 2
and 3, many early voting locations remained open well beyond 7:00pm.
On the final Saturday of early voting, over 30 locations were still
open at 9:00pm, and a few locations continued processing voters
through midnight.

    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{histogram_by_hour.pdf}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hist2012} displays the total number of voters who
voted early by the hour of the day at which they checked-in. Prior to
7:00pm, EViD check-ins were distributed fairly uniformly across the
day with a small peak before noon.  From 7:00am to 7:00pm, our
aggregated six counties consistently served approximately 70,000
Florida early voters per hour. Then, after 7:00pm, at which point new
voters could not join existing voting lines, the number of voters
served per hour dropped drastically---albeit but not entirely.  A
total of 83,250 (8.8\%) early voters in 2012 across the six counties
cast ballots after 7:00pm. These represent individuals who were in
line at the time the polls closed and were allowed to continue to wait
to vote.  We know that all of these voters had to wait in this way
although we do not know precisely how long each individual waited.  Of
this group, 36,120 voted after 8:00pm.  These voters waited at least
one hour to vote, and 13,567 voters, who checked-in after 9:00pm, must
have waited at least two hours to vote.

Aggregating across locations, Figure \ref{fig:race2012} describes the
composition of the 2012 early voting pool by race/ethnicity and by
hour of check-in.  For most of the day, whites were the majority
racial group, followed by blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.  This ranking
is similar to, but does not mirror, Florida's registered voter pool.
In the December 2012 Florida voter file, which lists 12,580,602
individuals, approximately 66.4 percent are white, 13.9 percent
Hispanic, 13.6 percent black, and 1.63 percent Asian.  As in years
prior, blacks in Florida in 2012 were disproportionate users of the
state's early voting period \citep{herronsmith:souls}.

What is striking in Figure \ref{fig:race2012}, however, is the
racial/ethnic composition of the early voting pool immediately before
and then after 7:00pm.  Simply put, the pool becomes rapidly non-white
starting around 7:00pm; by the 8:00pm-9:00pm window, the pool is less
than 25 percent white.

The party registration of the early voting pool varies slightly with
time although not nearly as starkly as its racial/ethnic composition.
This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:party2012}, which describes by
hour the partisan breakdown of all early voters in our six counties as
well as the party breakdown of the four aforementioned racial/ethnic
groups.  While Democrats made up 54\% of all those who voted early in
our set of Florida counties, we can see from the black line in the
figure that this percentage varied by hour of the day.  Notably,
Democrats composed a greater share of the voters in both the early
hours of voting and the hours after 7:00pm.  Hence, Democrats were
disproportionately affected by voting lines that forced voters to cast
their ballots after 7:00pm.

If we consider the breakdown of party registration by race/ethnicity,
as in Figure \ref{fig:party2012}, we can see how this effect might
largely be due to the aforementioned racial/ethnic patterns of voting.
For example, black early voters in Florida were almost entirely
Democratic, regardless of when they checked-in to vote.  Similarly,
the party registration of Hispanic voters---the least Democratic group
in the six counties---remained relatively constant throughout the day.
However we do see a slight trend for white and Asian early voters, who
became increasingly likely to be registered Democratic as time
progressed.

\subsubsection*{Early voting in 2016}

We now turn to early voting in the 2016 General Election.  By the time
this election had occurred, Florida had increased it number of early
voting days from eight to 14, ostensibly in an effort to reduce voting
location congestion. Was this change effective?  Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is analogous to the earlier figure that described
active early voting locations. Our six counties had 104 early voting
stations in place for the 2016 General Election.

    Election}
  \label{fig:nrlocs2016}
  \centering
    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{number_of_locations_2016.pdf}
\end{figure}

The most important aspect of Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is the
pictured dropoff in voter check-ins that occurred after 7:00pm.  There
were indeed check-ins that took place after this time but not nearly
as many as in 2012.  On the busiest day in 2012, more than half of the
polling locations were open past 9:00pm and more than five were open
past midnight.  On the busiest day in 2016, only six locations were
open past 9:00pm and not one early voter cast a ballot after 10:00pm.

In the introduction, we commented on improvements in voter wait times
that others, using surveys, have found in 2016 compared to 2012, and
Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is consistent with findings in the 2012
\citep{spae2012} and 2016 \citep{spae2016} versions of the SPAE.  See
Table \ref{tab:floridaspae}.  Early voting in 2016---at least in the
six Florida counties---appears to represent an improvement over 2012
in terms of reducing congestion, which is presumably tied not only to
the expanded number of sites but also to the number of days and hours
of allowable early voting.\footnote{We use the verb ``appears'' here
  because of voting-level sorting that may affect the types of
  individuals in Florida who cast their ballots prior to a given
  Election Day.  When the Florida state legislature changed the
  state's early voting period between 2012 and 2016, voters may have
  altered their most preferred voting times.}

\subsubsection*{Late voting in 2012 versus 2016}

Figure \ref{fig:race2012and2016} provides a race/ethnicity-based
perspective on the 2012 versus 2016 comparison for our six counties.
For three key racical/ethnic groups in Florida---black, Hispanic, and
white---the figure reveals the total number of check-ins by time,
aggregated across all days in the 2012 and 2016 early voting periods.

Figure \ref{fig:race2012and2016} shows that, not only did more voters
check-in for early voting in 2016 compared to 2012, fewer voters voted
past 7:00pm.  This is the case for black, Hispanic, and white
voters. Moreover, non-white early voters in Florida had
disproportionately late check-ins in 2012.  We already have seen
evidence of this, but Figure \ref{fig:race2012and2016} shows as well
how this problem did not appear in 2016.  There were slightly more
non-whites with late check-ins in 2016, but the magnitude of the white
versus non-white gap shrunk between the two years.

Even though 2016 attracted far more early voters than 2012, the
changes made to the early voting period appears to have reduced the
congestion outside of the polls. The increased number of days and
hours may have helped, as these six counties still served roughly the
same number of early voters per day in 2016 (approximately 120,516) as
they did in 2012 (approximately 117,771).

\subsection*{Effects of waiting to vote}

We now consider the effects on future electoral political
participation of waiting in line to vote.  In particular, we focus
first on the consequences of waiting in an early voting line in the
2012 General Election on turnout in the 2016 General Election.  We
then consider how waiting in line to vote early in 2012 affected early
voting in 2016.  And finally we consider how waiting in 2012 was
associated with turnout in 2014.

\subsubsection*{Effects of 2012 lines on 2016 turnout}

We have already noted that the individual-level EViD files we have
include Florida voter identification numbers, and this enables us to
link these files with statewide Florida voter files.  These latter
files specify the elections in which voters participated and, if so,
whether they voted absentee, early in-person, or on Election Day.
Thus, for any early voter in 2012 we can determine whether the
individual voted in the 2016 General Election, assuming that this
individual still lived in Florida as of November 2016.\footnote{When
  a registered voter moves within Florida, the voter maintains the
  same voter identification number.  Our estimates in this section are
  thus not confounded by the possibility of 2012 early voters moving
  across county lines within Florida.}

The difficulty in our exercise here is twofold.  First, while we know
voter check-in times from our EViD data, we do not know associated
voter wait times \emph{per se}.  To determine wait times precisely we
would have to know early voter arrival times, which are not collected
by election officials or anyone else for that matter.  Second, early
voters who voted at, say, 9:00am on a given day of early voting may be
systematically different from those who voted at 6:00pm. Consequently,
estimating the effect of voting after closing time---when we know
voters have waited in line---is potentially confounded by voter-level
selection.  Hence, we need to ensure that we control for differences
across early voters as best as we can so that selection into time of
early voting does not confound our estimates of the effect of waiting
on future turnout.

% Hence,
% distinguishing those early voters in 2012 who waited in line from
% those who did not is a challenge and requires an alternative method
% along with some assumptions.  

Our approach is as follows.  We condition on race/ethnicity,
partisanship (as before, measured by party registration), gender, age, neighborhood income,
and previous voting history.  And, we make the following assumption:
individuals who voted at Florida early voting locations which stayed
open well past the 7:00pm cutoff time are more likely to have waited
in line than those who voted in locations that closed before 7:00pm or
at this time exactly.  Moreover, we assume that those who voted just
before the 7:00pm cutoff in early voting locations that stayed open
late are more likely to have waited in line than those who voted
earlier in the day.  We cannot know for sure if these assumptions
hold, but there are reasons to believe that they do.

Take, for example, the two polling locations in Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2012}.  The first location---the Karl County Center in
Hillsborough County---closed on time on November 3, 2012.  Therefore,
we assume that the Karl Center was not a congested polling location
and that the voters who voted just before 7:00pm did not have to wait
in much of a line.  If they did have to wait in line to vote, then the
line remarkably stopped just in time for the final early voter to
check-in right before 7:00pm.  While this is technically possible, it
would be remarkably coincidental.

On the other hand, the second location in Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2012}---the West Kendall Library in Miami-Dade
County---remained open until around 1:00am on November 3.  We know
with certainty that this last voter waited in line to vote.  In fact,
because all voters had to arrive before 7:00pm in order to check-in,
we know with certainty that he or she waited at least six hours to
vote.  Moreover, we can be fairly confident that the voters who voted
just before 7:00pm here also waited in line.  Voting that continues
past 7:00pm is indicative of a polling place that was operating
essentially at capacity at 7:00pm.  Hence, those voters who voted just
before 7:00pm are similarly likely to have been caught up in a long
voting line.

With the above assumptions as background, our strategy for
distinguishing voters who waited in line from voters who did not wait
in line is first to identify those who voted in an an early voting
polling place that closed well past 7:00pm from those who voted in a
polling place that closed on time.  In other words, we attempt to
compare voters who cast their ballots in places like the Karl County
Center to voters who voted in places like the West Kendall Library.
More specifically, we want to compare those individuals who voted
closest to the 7:00pm cutoff, since those are the individuals who we
are most confident were affected by the congestion that caused polling
locations to close late.
 
Therefore, we create a variable that identifies all early voters who
voted at a polling location on a day where the last voter checked-in
past 7:30pm.  These are voters who cast ballots at locations where we
know the line at the end of the day was at least 30 minutes long.  We
call this variable \emph{Over}.  Conditioning on race/ethnicity,
partisanship, gender, age, log median household income at the zip-code level,
and previous voting record (whether the voter voted in the 2008
General Election), we use a logistic regression to estimate the effect
of voting at a polling location that is congested in 2012---one that
goes ``over'' 7:30pm---on the probability of voting in 2016:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textup{Pr}\left(\mathrm{Voted16}_{i} = yes\right) =  \textup{logit}^{-1}&(\beta + \alpha_{Over} + \gamma_{Hour} +
    \sigma_{Over \times Hour} + \upsilon_{Gender}  + \\& \rho_{Race/ethnicity} +
      \tau_{Age Group} + \psi_{Party} + \theta_{Income} + \pi_{Voted\emph{08}})
  \end{aligned}  
\end{equation*}
%
In the above model, $i$ denotes our collection of 2012 early voters
who appear in the history of Florida voting in 2008; $Over$ indicates
if the voter had to wait in line in 2012; $Hour$ indicates the hour of
the day in 2012 at which a voter checked-in, between 7:00am and
7:00pm; $Gender$ indicates whether the voter identifies as male or
female; $Race/ethnicity$ indicates if the voter self-identifies as
white, black, Hispanic, or Asian; $Age Group$ classifies voters
according to their 2016 age and bins them into 10-year age groups
(20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+); $Party$ indicates party
registration, either Democratic, Republican, No party affiliation, or
none of the above; $Income$ indicates median household income in a
voter's zip code;\footnote{U.S.\ Census Bureau, 2010-2014 American
  Community Survey 5-Year Estimates} and, $Voted08$ and $Voted16$ are
indicators for participation in the 2008 and 2016 General Elections.

The covariates in our regression are based on findings in the
literature on turnout in American elections.  This literature is
extensive, and among other things it considers how age
\cite{strateetal:age,hightonwolfinger:lifecycle}, gender
\cite{schlozman:genderdifferentvoice}, party
\cite{martinezgill:partisanturnout,grofmanetal:turnout}, and race
\cite{verbaetal:raceparticipation,fraga:raceturnout} are associated
with individual-level turnout decisions.  All told we estimate our
logistic regression based on 758,266 individuals, and coefficient
estimates appear in Table \ref{tab:reg} in the appendix.\footnote{Our
  regression is estimated only using individuals who voted before
  7:00pm.  In addition, we restrict attention to individuals who are
  registered either Democrat, Republican, or Independent, or have
  recorded no party affiliation.  Finally, we drop registered voters
  who have no recorded gender, race, or birthdate.}

Per the leftmost column (1) of Table \ref{tab:reg}, having voted in
2008 in Florida is positively associated with subsequent voting in
2016, and being older is associated with greater turnout,
\emph{ceteris paribus}.  The latter is consistent with findings on
turnout and age as discussed in \citet{costaetal:walkingthewalk}.  Our
age estimates in Table \ref{tab:reg} are presumably underestimated;
the regression model that generates them excludes the youngest voters
in 2016, who could not legally register to vote in Florida in 2008,
and younger registered voters are, \emph{ceteris paribus}, less likely
to turn out to vote \citep{shinosmith:registrationtiming}.  Table
\ref{tab:reg} also shows that, \emph{ceteris paribus}, registered men
vote less frequently than women and that registered whites vote often
than non-whites.  This gender finding is consistent with
\citet{leighleynagler:whovotesnow} although the race result is not.

Our objective is not to explore the relationship between demographic
covariates and voter turnout in Florida in 2016.  Rather, we want to
know about the marginal effect of waiting in line on future turnout,
and to this end Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2016} displays graphically the
probability of voting in 2016 of a black male between the ages of
50-60 who is a registered Democrat, voted in 2008, and lives in a
zip-code with the average median household income. 

Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2016} estimates are conditioned on each hour
of the early voting day in 2012. Its black points represent estimated
probabilities of voting in 2016 conditional on voting at a polling
location that closed \emph{before} 7:30pm; based on our discussion
above, these estimates reflect individuals who likely did not wait in
line.  In contrast, the grey points in Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2016}
are the estimated probabilities of voting in 2016 conditional on
casting an early ballot at a polling location that closed \emph{after}
7:30pm.  These estimates reflect individuals who likely did wait in
line to vote.  Hence, the difference between the figure's two sets of
estimates should reflect the effect of waiting in line.  Moreover, the
effect should be most isolated as one compares voters casting ballots
closer to 7:00pm.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\caption{Probability of voting in 2016, given 2012 check-in time}
  \label{fig:prvoting2016}
  \centering
    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{probability_of_voting_in_2016_over_under.pdf}
\end{figure}

One can see that, beginning at around 2:00pm, there is a small albeit
negative difference between individuals who voted in congested polling
places compared to those who cast their ballots in non-congested
places.  This suggests that voting lines may have started in the early
afternoon, and the reason there is no difference between congested and
non-congested polling places earlier in the day may be because long
lines had yet to form then. As congested polling places become
congested in the afternoon, we begin to see a small but statistically
significant effect on future political participation, an effect which
suggests that voting lines slightly dampen future electoral
participation.  The effect is small, amounting to no more than roughly
a percentage point difference.

Voting probability plots for other demographic groups are similar to
the plot in Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2016}, and rather than showing
many such plots we generalize the marginal effect of waiting in line
in 2012 on voting in 2016 to our complete sample.  Across our sample,
Figure \ref{fig:margfx2016} displays estimates, along with 95\%
confidence intervals, of the change in probability of voting in 2016
based on time of early vote in 2012.  We generated the results in the
Figure \ref{fig:margfx2016} with a simulation.  Our simulation (500
repetitions) drew from a multivariate normal distribution where the
mean vector consists of values of the coefficient vector corresponding
to the leftmost column (1) in Table \ref{tab:reg}.  The covariance
matrix for the multivariate normal is the estimated covariance matrix
from our logistic regression.  The numbers in Figure
\ref{fig:margfx2016} can be thought of as average treatment effects
where the treatment on individuals in our sample is being forced to
wait in a voting line in 2012.

\end{figure}


The point estimates in Figure \ref{fig:margfx2016} are all negative,
indicating that waiting in line in 2012 is associated with decreased
turnout probabilities in 2016.  The magnitude of the estimates range
from very small (e.g., a 0.03 percentage point difference in turnout
probabilities associated with waiting to vote at 7:00am) to slightly
over one percentage point later in the day.

Overall, our findings on the effects of lines---they depress future
turnout, albeit only barely---are similar to the conclusions in
\citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}.  In particular,
\citeauthor{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts} argues that each
hour an in-person voter spends waiting in line to vote is associated
with a one percentage point drop in the likelihood of future turnout.
To the best of our knowledge,
\citeauthor{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts} is the first scholar
to try to estimate the effect of waiting in line to vote on the later
propensity to vote, and our results are qualitatively similar to his.

Our regression results are based on individuals who were registered to
vote in Florida in 2008, 2012, and 2016.  Among other things, this
means that our analysis excludes the youngest registrants in Florida,
who were not legally permitted to be registered in Florida as of the
2008 General Election; individuals who moved to Florida from out of
state between the years of 2008 and 2016; registered Floridians who
died, were convicted of committing a felony, or adjudicated mentally
incompetent between 2008 and 2016; and, individuals who moved out of
the state between 2008 and 2016.

In light of these issues, a potential concern regarding our estimates
of the effect of waiting in line in 2012 on turnout in 2016 is that,
by selecting against younger voters, we are biasing our estimates of
these effects. To this end, there is a literature on waiting in line
in hospitals, and studies of the willingness of individuals to leave
emergency rooms without being seen by medical professionals find that
being young is a risk factor for this behavior
\citep{sunetal:lwbs,clareycooke:emergencyroomleave,shaikh:howlongwaiter}.
In other words, young individuals seems unduly sensitive to wait
times, what might be called impatience.  If this is true, then by
excluding relatively younger voters in our regression model, we are
making our results on the effect of waiting on future turnout
conservative.

Our regression analysis also selects against recent movers into or out
of and individuals who became felons, and thus lost the right to vote,
between 2008 and 2016.  We do not know of any theoretical or empirical
reasons to think that these types of individuals are systematically
different in terms of sensitivity to voting lines.  However,
conditioning our results on individuals who remained registered to
vote in Florida across a span of eight years presumably means that we
are conditioning our analysis on politically engaged individuals.
This will again make our results on the effect of voting lines on
future turnout conservative.

% While there may be idiosyncrasies in the rates at which the above
% types of individuals vote---e.g., young voters tend to have
% disproportionately low turnout rates
% \citep{shinosmith:registrationtiming}---whether these types of

% voter files.

\subsubsection*{Effects of 2012 lines on 2016 early voting}

Now restricting attention to 2016 voters only, we consider a second
logistic regression that analyzes whether these individuals voted
early in 2016---or, in contrast, voted in another fashion.
Corresponding regression results are in the second (2) column of Table
\ref{tab:reg}, and Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} contains a plot
of 2016 early voting probabilities that is structured similarly as our
earlier turnout probability plot.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \caption{The effect of waiting in line to vote in 2012 on voting early in 2016}
  \centering\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{margfx_2016_vote_early.pdf}
  \caption{Voting early in 2016}
  \label{fig:atevotingearly2016}
\end{figure}

Intuitively, and to the extent that time spent in line increase the
cost of voting, we would expect that waiting in an early voting line
in 2012 is associated with a decreased likelihood of voting early in
2016.  Indeed, Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} shows that the 2016
voters whom we identify as having waited in an early voting line in
2012 were less like to vote early in 2016, \emph{ceteris paribus}.
This result shows how some voters responded to high costs of early
voting by choosing an alternative way to vote in a later election, and
it highlights a downstream consequence of voting lines.  Still, Figure
\ref{fig:atevotingearly2016}'s percentage point gaps (black dot to
grey dot) are around one to two points, which is small albeit not
negligible.  Early voting, after all, was designed as a convenience,
and Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} suggests that the value of
this convenience can be lost in the shadow of a previous bad
experience.

There is a U-shape to the points in Figure
\ref{fig:atevotingearly2016}, and we can only speculate as to what is
responsible for this.  We know from the number of post-7:00pm closing
times that, in 2012, early voting locations were congested in the
evening.  We suspect that morning early voting hours also suffered
from congestion albeit from a different source, perhaps when
individuals stopped by to vote, say, before going to work.  If lines
discourage future early voting, this pattern would yield a U-shape as
in Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016}.  It is also interesting to
note that early voters in 2012 who voted at locations that closed
before 7:30pm also have a U-shape in their early voting probabilities.
We suspect this is because these locations probably suffered from
morning and evening lines, albeit not very long ones.\footnote{This
  discussion suggests that employed individuals may be
  disproportionately sensitive to waiting in line to vote, and this
  would be consistent with the relationship between affluence and
  tolerance for waiting in a supermarket line
  \citep[e.g.,][]{bennett:waitinginlinechars}.  There is no employment
  data in the Florida statewide voter files, but a relationship
  between work opportunities and one's willingness to wait in line is
  worth considering in future research.}

A full analysis of Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} is beyond our
scope.  However, what is most important about the figure is that it
highlights how voting experiences can affect forms of future political
participation.  Wanting to voting early, but not doing so on account
of fear of lines, imposes a cost on voters, and future research on
election administration needs to pay attention to the way that
electoral experiences, both positive and negative, can accumulate over
time and potentially affect future choices.

\subsubsection*{Effects of 2012 lines on 2014 turnout}

Our final set of results on the effects of lines considers turnout in
the 2014 General Election as a function of line waiting in 2012.  Our
use of voter behavior in 2014 is notable for two reasons.  First,
the year 2014 is only two years after 2012.  Thus, if the
effect of waiting in line attenuates in time (because bad memories of
line waiting become less salient, for example), we would expect to see
greater consequences of waiting in line on 2014 turnout compared to
2016 turnout. Moreover, the 2014 statewide election in
Florida was a midterm election as opposed to a presidential election.  
Given that midterms are generally less attractive to voters,
a negative experience in 2012 might be enough to discourage a voter from 
turning out to vote in 2014 when it might not have been enough to discourage
that same voter from voting in the presidential election in 2016.
Hence, having to wait in line to vote in 2012 would cause a more profound reduction in turnout in 2014
compared to 2016. 

On the other hand, midterm electorates may be more energized and politically
engaged than presidential electorates.  As a result, a negative experience waiting in line in 2012 might
not be enough to deter the already motivated midterm voter.  Hence, if this is the case,  we might expect to see smaller
effects of lines on 2014 turnout compared to 2016 turnout.  We cannot know which of these two effects
is greater, but we note them in the interest of transparency.

  %\caption{Turnout in 2014}
  \label{fig:prvoting2014}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2014} presents the effects of having to wait in line to 
vote in 2012 on the probability of voting in the 2014 midterm.  What is most
noticeable about this figure is that the effect of waiting in line to vote is much stronger in
2014 than it is in 2016.  Those who voted in
congested polling locations in 2012 were between 2.5 and 4.5 percentage points less likely to
vote in 2014 compared to those who voted in polling locations that were not so congested in 2012. 
Whereas in 2016, those same individuals were between 0 and 1.25 percentage points less likely
to vote.  This suggests that the negative experience in 2012 was more profound in altering midterm
turnout than it was in altering turnout in the presidential election two years later.

Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2014} and Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} share some similarities in that both
 the effects on 2014 turnout and the effects on 2016 turnout are conditional on the
hour in which one voted in 2012.  Afternoon voters were more affected by congested polling locations
than before-noon voters.  Although the condition is more pronounced in 2016,  we do see that the magnitude
of the effect in 2014 increases between noon and 3:00pm, and then gradually returns to before-noon effects
for voters who voted just before the 7pm cutoff.  While it is unclear why the effect is strongest just before 3:00pm, 
it is clear that there is a slight conditional effect of time, and that this effect is outweighed by a much stronger effect of
just having to vote in a congested precinct. 


\section*{Conclusion}

The extent to which all voters in an election are treated equally
depends in part on whether the cost of voting in the election is
distributed uniformly across voters. Administrative aspects of
elections that affect the cost of voting are thus part of the overall
calculus of whether an election was characterized by equal treatment
or the lack thereof.  A notable administrative aspect of elections is
the presence of voting lines, and lengthy voting lines in recent
United States General Elections have been of concern, both to scholars
and election officials.  Burdensome wait times not only impose
opportunity costs on those forced to wait in line, but they can also
discourage future electoral participation.

Research on voting lines is challenged by the lack of observational
data on who waits to vote.  Other than noting the times at which polls
officially closed and recording information about which voters cast
their ballots after voting lines were capped, there is little data
collected by election officials that might distinguish between those
who waited in line to vote from those who did not.  Notwithstanding a
limited number of exceptions, local election officials do not maintain
official records on line evolution or how long individual voters
waited \citep{herron:confidence}.

% Previous research using election
% records to study lines have thus been limited to examining variables
% like aggregate precinct results
% \citep[e.g.,][]{herronsmith:closingtimes,
%   pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}.  Data limitations have
% prevented these projects from identifying individuals who waited in
% line from those who did not \emph{within} the same precinct.

To overcome the lack of data that identifies who waits in line to
vote, scholars have relied on surveys that ask respondents to recall
their experiences at the polls and report the length of time that they
waited to vote \citep{stewart:waitingtovote2012,
  pettigrew:racegapwaittimes}.  These survey-based analyses have
illuminated important variation in wait times across geographies and
racial/ethnic groups, but associated with them is the caveat that
survey responses are subject to biases associated with self-reporting.

With these points in mind, we contribute to the literature on voting
lines by analyzing early voter check-in times in Florida's 2012 and
2016 General Elections. Using electronic voting check-in time stamps
from Alachua, Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, and Palm
Beach Counties, we are able to identify the exact day and time at
which many thousands of voters checked-in to vote.  These check-in
times not only provide novel insight into voting patterns across time
but, given some natural assumptions, also allow us to characterize
individual voters who likely waited in line to vote. Of course,
despite their advantages, EViD check-in times are not a panacea in the
quest to understand voting lines and their consequences, as such times
do not specify how long an individual may have waited to vote.  

% As
% such, our our analysis of check-in times should be viewed as a
% complement to studies using survey and other observational methods to
% explain who waits in line and for how long.

Our analysis reveals that Florida's early voting period in 2012 had a
significant number of voters who voted past the official 7:00pm
closing time and, therefore, must have waited in line to vote.  These
voters were disproportionately black, Hispanic, and Democratic---a
finding that coincides with survey results on voting lines.  In 2016,
we find that congestion observed in 2012 had all but vanished.  Voters
rarely voted late into the night in 2016, and most early voting
locations in our Florida counties of interest closed promptly.  Even
though the counties we study in 2016 served as many individual per day
as they had in 2012, they appear to have been more prepared to handle
the high rates of early voting.
  
We estimated the effect that waiting in line has on future electoral
participation.  Using temporal variation in voting across polling
locations, we found a very slight negative effect on turnout,
amounting to no more than a one percentage point decrease in the
propensity to vote. The result is similar to that identified by
\citet{pettigrew:racegapwaittimes}.  The effect is small in magnitude,
which is normatively pleasing, but any negative effect on future
turnout is normatively troubling.  Not only are some voters penalized
by waiting in line, but a small number of these individuals appear to
be dissuaded from voting in the future, thus lessening their voices.
We offered some evidence as well that long early voting lines dissuade
voters from casting early ballots.  To the extent that early voting is
a form of ``convenience'' voting, this result shows how the value of
this convenience can be compromised by long lines, something that most
observers would classify as administrative failures.

Overall, our evidence shows that the 2012 General Election in Florida
did not treat all voters equally with respect to time spent waiting in
line.  Minority voters in 2012 voters faced disproportionately long
lines---thus, disproportionately high costs of voting---and then, in
some cases, a small downstream effect of a decreased propensity to
vote.  Our results illustrate how administrative aspects of elections,
like the resource allocation decisions that influence whether an
election will have lines or not, should be understood not just as
administrative in nature but also as relevant to underlying fairness
and the extent to which voters are treated in a like manner.

% Except for the few states that require voters to cast ballots by mail
% (or use drop off boxes), waiting to vote at the polls is likely to
% continue to be an inevitable part of the voting experience for voters
