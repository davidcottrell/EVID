\section*{Introduction}

Modern democracies are characterized by regular and free elections,
the legitimacy of which can suffer in the face of perceptions of
unfairness and unequal treatment of voters
\citep{norris2014electoral}. An election can fail to treat all voters
equally if there are meaningful differences in vote tabulating
technologies across an electorate \citep{kimballkropf:tech}; if some
voters must contend with registration hurdles that others do not
\citep{ansolhersh:registration}; if some voters face strict photo
identification requirements and others no such requirements
\citep{benteleetal:newjimcrow}; and, if some voters have to travel
much longer distances than others to cast their ballots
\citep{dyckgimpel:distance}. More generally, when in a given election
the \emph{cost of voting} in the sense of \cite{downs:econtheory}
varies significantly by voter group---where group membership could be
based on race/ethnicity or party affiliation, for example---the
principle of equal treatment of voters is at risk.

%   Elections affected by fraud certainly fall in this
% category, as \citet{cottrelletal:fraud2016} argue, and elections
% conducted in the midst of acrimonious debates over the nature of the
% franchise risk being thought of as unfair \citet{hasen:votingwars}.
% Fairness can also be in the eye of the beholder:
% \citet{sancesstewart:confidence} show how confidence in a given
% election outcome can be a function of whether an individual's
% preferred candidate won.



% The connection between lines and
% equal treatment is straightforward: if lines adversely affect some
% types of voters more than others, then the cost of voting will vary
% systematically by voter group, threatening the principle of equal
% treatment of voters.

% Thus, any assessment of
% the extent to which a given election featured equal treatment of
% voters must include an analysis of voting lines and whether certain
% groups of individuals waited in disproportionately long  lines.

%  In-person voting experiences have a number of
% features that are distinct from the experiences of those who vote by
% mail, and our interest here is the act of waiting in line.

% Casting an in-person ballot requires traveling to
% a voting precinct; possibly spending time in a line prior to voting;
% authenticating oneself in some fashion to election officials;
% physically registering candidate and ballot measure preferences; and,
% submitting a ballot for tabulation.  

%% 2016 EAC is from p. 10
%% really think we need to stick with polling station terminology, not precincts, as early voting is not precinct-based.

% as opposed to lines in
% which voters, already in the act of casting ballots, are forced to
% stand. 

There are two reasons that voting lines, whose lengths reflect
interactions between in-person voter turnout at polling locations and
administrative decisions about resource allocation
\citep{herronsmith:hanoverstudy}, are related to equal treatment.
First, waiting in line to vote is a time tax
\citep{mukherjee:timetax}. This tax can be negligible---for example, a
voter waits a scant number of seconds prior to initiating her voting
process---or imposing---some of the Florida voters we describe shortly
waited several hours to vote in 2012. Associated with a voting line
time tax are the distributional questions associated with all forms of
taxation: is the burden of this tax spread equally across voters or
concentrated on groups of them?

Second, waiting in line to vote may have ``downstream'' electoral
effects in the sense of
\citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}. When an individual is
compelled to pay a relatively high tax in order to participate in a
political activity, a natural response might be to avoid the activity,
or substitute for it, in the future. If voting lines operate in this
fashion, then they will depress voter turnout. And if lines affect
some voter groups more than others, then their associated depressive
effect on turnout will not burden all voters equally. Unequal burdens
notwithstanding, given the relatively low rate of voter participation
in American presidential elections---approximately 58 percent of the
eligible population turned out in 2012 and 60 percent in 2016---any
aspect of the voting experience that may have a depressive effect on
turnout should be considered a matter worthy of study.\footnote{The
  national turnout rate for a general election
  depends on the way that the number of eligible voters in the country
  is calculated.  The figures cited here are from the United States
  Election Project, available at
  \url{http://www.electproject.org/home} (last accessed December 11,
  2017).\label{fn:uselectionproject}}

% To make matters
% concrete, if a line in front of a particular restaurant is long, some
% individuals may substitute an alternative eatery for the restaurant in
% question, one without an imposing line, or even forego
% eating.\footnote{Alternatively, a line in front of a restaurant might
%   be a quality signal, in which case the presence of a line might be
%   an incentive to wait in it.  The same could be said for voting, and
%   here we ignore the possibility that lines form due to potential
%   voters using the presence of lines as a means to gather information
%   on whether voting is valuable.}

%  While it is not
% \emph{a priori} clear that voting can be substituted for in the way
% that selecting a restaurant might be, we should not dismiss outright
% the possibility that the effect of waiting in line to vote, which as
% we have already argued raises the cost of voting, might decrease the
% likelihood of voting in the future.  

The time tax associated with voting lines and their potential
downstream consequences are conceptually distinct. The former could be
uniformly spread across voters, which might be normatively pleasing in
the sense of not violating equal treatment, and yet there could be a
significant effect of waiting in line on future electoral
participation. Or, the time tax could be concentrated on certain voter
groups, violating equal treatment regardless of whether there are
downstream consequences of waiting to vote.

Given the relationship between voting lines and potential violations
of equal treatment, one would expect a robust literature to have
developed on this subject.  This has not happened, however.
Notwithstanding post-election surveys of voters aimed at understanding
their experiences at the polls, little is known about the distribution
of wait times among voters. This measurement problem, we argue, is the
most meaningful impediment to voting lines research.

To address this impediment, we turn to a relatively untapped source of
electoral information: early voter check-in times from Florida
counties in the 2012 and 2016 General Elections. We provide details
shortly on check-in times, but for the moment it suffices to note that
a voter's check-in time is when he or she began to vote. The thousands
of check-in times that form the basis of our research design have two
valuable features. One, they are automatically generated by machines
installed in voting locations. And two, they are linkable to public
records on voter demographics and previous voting
history.\footnote{Registered voters moving within Florida maintain
  their voter identification numbers.}

These advantages notwithstanding, check-in times by themselves cannot
specify the lengths of the lines at the polls in which voters waited
before checking-in to vote.  Rather, our analysis of lines is based on
an identifying assumption, that late-closing voting locations in
Florida were disproportionately affected by voting lines. Our data
support this assumption, but like any assumption it cannot be
completely verified.  Importantly, our research design differs from
existing designs in the voting lines literature, the latter assuming
that voters when surveyed can accurately recount how long they waited
in line to vote. By dint of triangulation we argue that the study of
voting lines will be strengthened to the extent that it incorporates
varied approaches, each with its own assumptions.

% With this in mind, our empirical
% analysis of voting lines during early in-person voting in Florida is
% divided into two sections. First, we assess the types of voters who in
% 2012 experienced voting lines prior to casting their ballots. Second,
% we consider whether individuals who waited excessively to vote in 2012
% were less likely to vote in subsequent elections, namely, in 2014 and
% 2016.

% One of the difficulties in studying voting lines in the United States
% is data availability: it is not easy to determine precisely how long
% voters waited in line at the polls.  It is accordingly difficult to
% study if there are consequences for subsequent voting behavior of
% waiting in line.  Some researchers have dealt with this hurdle by
% using surveys---either Election Day exit polls or post-election
% questionnaires---which integrate responses to waiting time questions
% with other survey items, namely socioeconomic and partisan queries
% \citep{stewart:waitingtovote2012}.  Post-election surveys on voting
% experiences can foster access to wide swaths of voters, and this is
% valuable.  A limitation of surveys regarding electoral experiences,
% though, is that they rely on self-reports of wait times, which may not
% be accurate, and in addition it is known that self-reporting of
% turnout in general can suffer from over-reporting
% \citep{karpbrockington:overreport,bellietal:overreport}.

%In light of potential concern with survey-based evidence on voting
%lines,

% Still, in the interests
% of being transparent about limitations in our research design, a
% voter's check-in time is not directly connected to the amount of time
% she spent waiting in line.  We describe below how we link voter
% check-in times with corresponding waiting times, but the connection is
% not perfect.

Regarding the time tax associated with waiting to vote, we find a
disproportionate concentration of this tax on minority voters. The
situation was worse in Florida in 2012 than in 2016; consistent with
national, survey-based evidence on voting lines, our check-in times
highlight fewer troubling issues in the latter presidential
election.\footnote{For a national 2012 versus 2016 comparison, see
  \url{http://electionupdates.caltech.edu/2016/12/14/this-just-in-lines-at-the-polls-shorter-in-2016-than-in-2012}
  (last accessed March 30, 2017), as well as
  \url{http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/fortier-and-palmer-column-who-waits-the-longest-to-vote/article_81efabad-aa23-577b-83d1-0e524cf844ef.html}
  (last accessed June 30, 2017).} Regarding the effect of waiting to
vote in 2012, we find small yet negative consequences for turnout in
the 2016 General Election. As a consistency check on this result, we
find similar effects of waiting in line in 2012 on turnout in the 2014
Midterm Election. While the consequences of excessive line waiting on
turnout are not negligible, they are nonetheless small, in the vicinty
of one to three percentage points, consistent with the findings of
\citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}. We also find that early
voters in 2012 who waited in line to vote were less likely to vote
early in 2016, \emph{ceteris paribus}.


%  Whether the recent decrease in
% Florida waiting times reflects progress in local election
% administration, voter sorting, or idiosyncrasies in the 2012 or 2016
% General Election is not clear. Two election-years of data are
% insufficient to gauge broad electoral environment changes in a state
% as populous and heterogeneous as Florida.

% conditional on our strategy for identifying those
% Florida early voters who suffered long waits in 2012, 


In what follows we situate our study in the literature on voting lines
and election administration. We then turn to early voting check-in
times in Florida and explain how these times can be interpreted. Our
empirical results on lines are divided into two sections: first we
describe the distribution of the voting time tax across our set of
Florida voters, and second we analyze the downstream effects of the
tax. We conclude with observations about congestion at the polls and
equal treatment of voters.

\section*{Voting lines and equal treatment in American elections}

Voting is a fundamental right in the United States. Exercising this
right entails costs, as discussed by \cite{downs:econtheory} in his
formulation of the calculus of voting, and an excessively high cost of
voting can debase the right to vote. Per the United States Supreme
Court in \emph{Reynolds v.\ Sims} (1964), ``[T]he right of suffrage
can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's
vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of
the franchise.''\footnote{See
  \url{https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html}
  (last accessed December 12, 2017) for the text of the decision.} In
assessing the costs of voting that could operate in this way, the
court has considered laws relating to redistricting (\emph{Shaw v.\
  Reno} (1993)), literacy tests (\emph{Oregon v.\
  Mitchell} (1970)), proof of citizenship (\emph{Arizona v.\ Inter
  Tribal Council of Arizona} (2012)), voter identification
(\emph{Crawford v.\ Marion County
  Election Board} (2008)), and the purging of registered voters
(\emph{Husted v.\ A.\ Philip Randolph Institute} (2018)). In various
cases, the Court has been asked to balance state interests with the
equal treatment of voters.  Although there is ample evidence that long
voting lines in Florida in the 2012 General Election
disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities
\citep{herron_smith2014}, as of yet the Supreme Court has not been
asked to rule on whether Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act applies to
excessively long wait times at the polls, which in principle could
constitute ``a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of
the United States to vote on account of race or color'' (52 U.S.C.\ \S
10301(a)).

A lack of Court attention notwithstanding, voting lines have received
considerable attention in the last several election cycles in the
United States.  ``To me,'' Cynthia Perez complained in March 2016
after seeing a line wending its way around an early voting center in
Maricopa County, Arizona, with those in line reporting standing in
line for more than three hours before checking in to vote, ``this is
not what democracy is about.''\footnote{Quote drawn from ``Angry
  Arizona Voters Demand: Why Such Long Lines at Polling Sites?''
  \emph{The New York Times}, March 24, 2016, available at
  \url{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/us/angry-arizona-voters-demand-why-such-long-lines-at-polling-sites.html}
  (last accessed December 15, 2017)} Ahead of her state's 2016
presidential primary, election administrators in Maricopa County (over
four million residents and one of the largest counties in the United
States) had cut the number of Election Day polling places by roughly
70 percent, increasing the strain on early voting
centers.\footnote{According to the 2012-2016 American Community
  Survey, 5-Year Estimates, the population of Maricopa County is
  4,088,549.}  Voters in a handful of states also experienced long
lines in the 2016 General Election, but their experiences were largely
mild compared to what transpired four years prior in
Florida.\footnote{On various states with line issues in 2016, see
  ``Why Long Voting Lines Could Have Long-Term Consequences,''
  \emph{The New York Times}, November 8, 2016, available at
  \url{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/upshot/why-long-voting-lines-today-could-have-long-term-consequences.html}
  (last accessed December 9, 2017).  On Georgia, see ``Early voting
  lines are so long, people are fainting. That harms democracy,''
  \emph{The Guardian}, October 19, 2016,
  \url{https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/early-voting-lines-georgia}
  (last accessed December 9, 2017).} In 2011, the Florida legislature
curtailed the state's early voting period, resulting in long lines for
many electors who tried to vote in person during the truncated early
voting period in the 2012 General Election
\citep{herron_smith2014}. Following the election and public anger over
waits at the polls, then-President Barack Obama formed a Presidential
Commission to address general election administrative issues in the
United States. In doing so, he highlighted the plight of 102-year old
Desiline Victor, a Haitian-American woman who on October 27, 2012,
waited in line for nearly four hours at Florida's North Miami Public
Library early voting center. Obama's Presidential Commission devoted
some of its January 2014 report to lines, concluding that, ``[A]s a
general rule, no voter should have to wait more than half an hour in
order to have an opportunity to vote'' \citep[p.\
13,][]{pcea:2014}.\footnote{The executive order creating this
  commission is available at
  \url{https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/28/executive-order-establishment-presidential-commission-election-administr}
  (last accessed July 12, 2017).}

Voting lines are potential issues wherever voters cast their ballots
in-person as opposed to voting remotely via mail.  The vast
majority---over 75 percent in 2016 and approximately 66 percent in
2012---of voters in the United States who cast ballots in presidential
elections do so in-person, either on an Election Day itself or during
a corresponding early voting period whose duration depends on relevant
local laws.\footnote{For the composition of the 2012 and 2016
  electorates, see \citet{eac:2012} and \citet{eac:2016},
  respectively.}  As of the writing of this paper, there only three
states---Colorado, Oregon, and Washington---in which almost every
ballot is cast via mail.\footnote{See ``EAVS DEEP DIVE: EARLY,
  ABSENTEE AND MAIL VOTING,'' United States Election Assistance
  Commission, October 17, 2017, available at
  \url{https://www.eac.gov/documents/2017/10/17/eavs-deep-dive-early-absentee-and-mail-voting-data-statutory-overview}
  (last accessed September 13, 2018).}


\subsection*{Survey-based research on voting lines}

% These anecdotes raise questions about voting lines in general---in
% particular, how long they tend to be and which voters have to wait in
% them, how much variance there is across jurisdictions in waiting
% times, and what consequences lines have, if any, beyond the cost of
% standing in line.  

With few exceptions \citep[e.g.,][]{spencermarkovits:renege,
  herronsmith:hanoverstudy, pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts},
much of what we know about voter wait times is derived from survey
research. Most notably, \citet{stewart:waitingtovote2012} and
coauthors have conducted internet-based surveys in the United States
following the last three general elections. These surveys query voters
about their experiences at the polls and include items on wait times.
\citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012}'s \emph{Survey of the
  Performance of American Elections} (SPAE), which reaches 200
individuals in each state and Washington, D.C., and the Cooperative
Congressional Election Study (CCES) both contain questions about voter
wait times. According to \citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012}, wait
times across the country vary considerably, but a state's average wait
tends to be consistent across elections. Floridians regularly report
having to endure some of the longest wait times in the country; in
2012 in-person voters in Florida reported waiting 39 minutes on
average prior to voting, three times the national average.


% Surveys like the SPAE can also help identify when during the voting process
% wait times are most likely to occur.  In the 2012 General Election,
% \citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012} documented that over
% three-fifths of early in-person voters nationwide who reported waiting
% in line to vote said their wait was primarily during the check-in
% stage.

% Surveys are also helpful when trying to tease out the possibility of
% differential voting line time taxes across sub-populations of voters.

In other survey-based work on voting lines, \cite{mukherjee:timetax}
draws on 2008 CCES data and finds that minority voters were
disproportionately likely to pay a time tax when queuing to vote.
\citet{kimball:voting}, using the 2012 SPAE, reports that voters in
urban areas faced longer lines than rural voters, and
\citet{pettigrew:racegapwaittimes} estimates that typically non-white
voting locations in the United States were associated with voter wait
times approximately twice as long as those in white locations.
Building on the 2008 General Election research design of
\citet{alvarez:survey}, \cite{stewart:waitingtovote2012} finds in a
study of the 2012 General Election that, on average, African-Americans
had to wait 23 minutes to vote compared to 12 minutes for whites and
19 for Hispanics. \citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012} concludes
that these differences in wait times could be ``due to factors
associated with where minority voters live, rather than with minority
voters as individuals'' (pp.\ 457-458). Lastly,
\cite{herron:confidence} report based on exit polls conducted across
Miami-Dade precincts that those who waited longer in line in the 2014
Midterm Election had less confidence in electoral processes.

The utility of surveys in the study of voter wait times depends on a
crucial assumption: voter self-reports of wait times are accurate.  In
light of literature on memory distortion, this assumption is not
trivial. Memory confidence and memory accuracy can be negatively
associated \citep{hirstetal:sept11memories}, how an individual thinks
about a given task can be related to the extent to which she thinks
about the passage of time \citep{conti:timeflies}, and one's enjoyment
of a task can depend on feelings about time progression
\citep{sackettetal:timeflies}.  In short, it is not obvious that
scholars interested in wait times should be optimistic that voters in
the aftermath of an election can accurately report how long they
waited before voting.  This point notwithstanding, overreporting of
turnout is a known problem \citep{ansolhersh:bigdata}, which can
confound surveys on voter experiences.

% The point we are articulating here is that the survey-based designs
% that anchor most of the literature on voting lines incorporate a
% strong assumption about accurate recall. We avoid this particular
% assumption by leveraging data that do not depend on surveys.

\subsection*{An alternative to voter line surveys}

In contrast to survey-based research, our design aimed at
understanding the extent and consequences of voting lines draws on
\mbox{observed} check-in times of voters in Florida who cast their
ballots at early, in-person polling sites prior to the 2012 and 2016
General Elections. We explain below what we mean by a check-in time,
but for the moment we note that in 2016 more Florida voters---3.88
million---cast early in-person ballots than voters who mailed in their
absentee ballots (2.76 million) or who voted in person at local
Election Day precincts (2.96 million) \citep{FDOS:2016vote}. The
millions of individuals who cast early, in-person votes in Florida are
not unique to this state. Across the United States, early voting is
increasingly popular, as described in
\citet{neelyrichardson:earlyvoting}, \citet{gronkebaum:growth},
\citet{gronketoffey:psychological}, and
\citet{burdenetal:unanticipated}.

% \citet{gronke:earlyvotingreforms},
% \citet{gronke:2012}, 


% Although there are debates in the
% literature about the extent to which early voting has changed the
% electorate, if at all, here we take this mode of voting as given.

Florida notwithstanding, there is good reason to focus on wait times
during early in-person voting. Michael McDonald, on his Election
Project website, estimates that over 23 million voters cast early
in-person ballots in ``advance'' of the November 8, 2016, General
Election, some 17 percent of the 137 million votes
cast.\footnote{These numbers are drawn from the United States Election
  Project; see fn.\ \ref{fn:uselectionproject}.} If one were to be
concerned that a focus on early voters in Florida limits our scope,
these figures imply that our results are relevant for millions of
Americans.

In terms of our use of Florida voting data, the state's open records
laws make it an excellent laboratory for the study of election
administration. Drawing on Florida's statewide voter registration
records, \cite{herron_smith2013} trace the ebb and flow of new voter
registrations after the state legislature placed restrictions on
groups engaged in voter registration drives, and
\cite{shinosmith:registrationtiming} demonstrate that individuals who
register to vote immediately prior to a registration deadline are more
likely to turn out in a proximate general election but not in
subsequent elections.  See  \cite{amos_etal2017} and
\cite{herronsmith:closingtimes} for other examples of election
scholarship that leverages Florida's open records laws.

While the state's records laws facilitate election scholarship,
Florida grants considerable privacy to voters.  With the exception of
those serving as candidate, political party, or ballot issue
representatives, state law prohibits precinct observers from tracking
voting processes inside polling places. This effectively precludes
scholars who want to understand why lines form in front or inside
Florida precincts from replicating observational studies of voter
activities in the vein of \possessivecite{spencermarkovits:renege}
study of California and \possessivecite{herronsmith:hanoverstudy}
research on New Hampshire.

\section*{Florida early voting check-in times}

Election administration in Florida---registering voters, determining
precinct sizes, staffing and locating polling places, and setting
early voting days and hours---is largely controlled at the county
level within a framework established by the Florida state
legislature. Our early voting check-in times are thus gleaned from
public records requests made to Florida counties.

% , and these times cover check-ins
% across a variety of early voting stations during the 2012 and 2016
% General Elections.  

An eligible Florida voter casting his or her ballot prior to Election
Day may vote at any early voting polling location in the county in
which he or she is registered. This is distinct from in-person,
Election Day voting, during which a registered Floridian may vote only
at his or her assigned precinct, and it necessitates that a county
track its early voters. Rather than relying on traditional,
paper-based pollbooks to track these individuals, the 67 county
Supervisors of Elections in Florida use electronic pollbooks to
check-in voters during the state's early voting period. These
pollbooks are for the most part known as Electronic Voter
iDentification machines, or EViDs for short. Although there is
variance across Florida counties in electronic pollbook
implementation, for simplicity we refer to all electronic pollbooks as
EViD machines.\footnote{Nearly all counties use EViD machines supplied
  by VR Systems. See ``An EViD to Meet Your Needs,'' available at
  \url{https://www.vrsystems.com/Products/EViD} (last accessed May 11,
  2019).  A few counties use a different electronic voting system to
  process its early voters (phone call with Cathy Fowler, office of
  the Sarasota Supervisor of Elections, on March 31, 2017).}

% EViD machines allow county pollworkers to process Floridians casting

%is designed to reduce the time it takes to process early voters, and

Florida's EViD system facilitates synchronization across a county's
early voting centers as well as with the Florida statewide voter
database.  The state's EViD machines record the check-in times for all
early voters, thus providing us with \mbox{timestamps} specifying when
a voter began his or her voting process.  Using these timestamps we
can, for example, identify early voters who had not checked-in when
polls closed at 7:00pm on a given day of early voting but nonetheless
cast ballots. Per Florida state law, any elector in line at 7:00pm is
allowed to cast a ballot.\footnote{See ``The 2017 Florida Statutes,''
  Title IX ELECTORS AND ELECTIONS, Chapter 100, Section 100.011,
  available at
  \url{http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App\_mode=Display\_Statute\&Search\_String=\&URL=0100-0199/0100/Sections/0100.011.html}
  (last accessed December 15, 2017).}

We obtained EViD check-in times from \numcounties\ Florida counties:
Alachua, Broward, Hernando, Hillsborough, Levy, Miami-Dade, Orange,
Osceola, Palm Beach, and Putnam.\footnote{From the EViD files we
  received from Florida Supervisors of Elections, we removed all votes
  cast outside of official early voting periods, i.e., votes cast on
  election day to the extent that these votes are included in EViD
  files.}  This group covers large and urban (Broward and Miami-Dade)
as well as rural (Levy and Putnam) counties.  Table
\ref{tab:evidcounts} contains counts of early voting EViD timestamps
per county. In the 2012 General Election, there were 2,409,097 total
early ballots cast in Florida, and in 2016, 3,876,753 early
ballots.\footnote{2012 General Election turnout statistics are located

  \url{http://dos.myflorida.com/media/697842/2016-ge-summaries-ballots-by-type-activity.pdf}
  (last accessed December 10, 2017).} Our EViD data cover
approximately 42 (46) percent of all early in-person ballots cast in
Florida in the 2012 (2016) General Election.\footnote{Table
  \ref{tab:evidcounts} does not include 116 EViD check-in times (29
  from 2012 and 87 from 2016) listed as midnight.  We are suspicious
  that these particular times are not accurate and hence drop them. Of
  the thousands of EViD check-ins we analyze here, these cases are
  negligible.\label{fn:midnight}.}  EViD timestamps are associated
with official Florida voter identification numbers, which we can link
to the nearly 14 million individual voter registration records in
Florida's statewide voter file. To this end, we merge our EViD
timestamps with statewide voter files that cover the 2012 and 2016
General Elections.\footnote{Per Table \ref{tab:evidcounts}, we observe
  1,012,566 early voters across our \numcounties\ counties in 2012 and
  1,795,548 early voters in 2016. Of 2012 (2016) early voters, 53,188
  (14,911) could not be matched to the registration records we have
  from the January 2014 (2016) statewide Florida voter extract file.
  In any analysis that uses demographic or partisan information about
  the voters, we drop those voters who could not be matched to
  registration records.}

In 2012, all 67 Florida counties offered between six and 12 daily
hours of early voting over an eight-day period (Saturday through
Saturday) that ended immediately prior to the General Election,
November 6, 2012.  In 2016, after long lines in 2012 had apparently
convinced the state legislature to grant counties more flexibility in
offering early voting opportunities, counties were permitted to offer
up to 12 hours of early voting per day, spread over 14 days, ending
the final Sunday before the November 8, 2016, General Election.
Counties were permitted to offer a maximum of 168 total hours of early
voting.\footnote{See then-Florida Governor Rick Scott's statement,
  issued in the aftermath of the 2012 General Election, available at

Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} displays the distribution of EViD check-in
times at the Fred B.\ Karl County Center in Hillsborough County and
the West Kendall Regional Library in Miami-Dade County on the last
Saturday (November 3) of the 2012 General Election early voting
period. The figure describes in ten minute blocks the number of voters
who checked into these two polling stations. Counts begin with the
first voter who checked-in just as polls opened at 7:00am, and they
end with the last voter who checked-in.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \label{fig:kendallexample}
  \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Both panels in Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} contain vertical black
lines at 7:00pm. This is the time beyond which voters were not allowed
to join a (possibly existing) voting line. In the Hillsborough County
location (Figure \ref{fig:karlexample}), no check-ins occurred after
7:00pm, and from this it follows that, at 7:00pm, there was no voting
line. In contrast, the Miami-Dade location (Figure
\ref{fig:kendallexample}) had many post-7:00pm check-ins, the last one
of which occurred around 1:00am on Sunday, November 4. We thus know
that the last-voting voter at West Kendall Regional Library waited
almost six hours to vote.

Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist}'s bar shading reflects self-reported voter
race/ethnicity. Early voters at the Fred B.\ Karl County Center were
primarily white, although toward the end of November 3 the fraction of
non-white voters trended up. At the West Kendall Regional Library, the
vast majority of the early voting pool was non-white, the fraction of
non-white voters being roughly consistent across November 3.

Lastly, we observe a flatter, more-uniform distribution of check-in
times at Karl County Center than in West Kendall Library. We draw on
this pattern later when we try to determine which early voters in our
\numcounties\ counties waited in line, and here we provide some
intuition. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist}, it appears
that early voting locations in Florida that shut down very late had
flatter distributions of check-in times. We suspect that this is
evidence of persistent lines. In contrast, the non-uniformity of
check-in times that we observe in Figure \ref{fig:karlexample} is
consistent with an ebb and flow of voters. We know that there was not
a line to vote at Karl County Center at 7:00pm on Saturday, November
3, this despite the fact that, per check-in times, the Center was
regularly processing voters.

% Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} highlights both the value and a key
% limitation of EViD check-in times, namely, that check-in times are not
% linked to voter arrival times. All data sources and research designs
% have advantages and disadvantages, and in what follows we draw on the
% former and attempt to work with the latter.

\section*{Results}

We present results in two sections.  First, we describe patterns in
check-in times across the 2012 and 2016 General Elections with
particular attention to race/ethnicity and partisanship.  Second, we
consider the downstream consequences of extensive early voting wait
times.

% based
% on a identifying assumption we use to characterize individuals who
% waited in line before voting.

\subsection*{Who waits?}

Our analysis of who waits to vote turns in large part on check-in
times that occurred \emph{after} 7:00pm on a day of early voting.  Any
voter with such a late check-in must have waited to vote.

In 2012, there were across our \numcounties\ Florida counties 78XXX
early voting stations in 2012 that serviced voters in an eight day
long, early voting period.\footnote{Early voting locations in 2012
  where two or fewer individuals recorded votes were dropped from our
  analysis.  Some of our county EViD timestamp files lack voting
  location data.  To determine the locations at which affected voters
  cast their ballots, we link voters' early voting records to files that
  record the location of every early vote in Florida. See Florida Division of Elections, 
  ``Early Voting Locations and Times - Statewide File,'' available at
  \url{https://dos.myflorida.com/media/697189/early-voting-locations-and-times-2016-general-election_eng.pdf} 
  (last accessed May 11, 2019).}  Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2012} describes by day of early voting and by hourly
window the number of locations across our counties that actively
served voters. Most locations served early voters virtually the entire
day, and this is evident in the flat line, for the most part pegged a
bit under 80XXX prior to 7:00pm, at the top of the figure.  The most
notable exception to this pattern occurred at the earliest time of the
day, during which several early voting stations lacked active voters.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\end{figure}

After 7:00pm (note the vertical black line at this time), Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2012} shows that check-in uniformity across early
voting stations quickly changed.  On initial days within Florida's
eight-day long early voting period in 2012, there was a steep drop in
active stations starting at this time.  Even with this drop, however,
there were still at least five open locations at 9:00pm on every day
of early voting.  Then, on the last two days of early voting, November
2 and 3, many early voting stations remained open well beyond 7:00pm.
On the final Saturday of early voting, over 30 stations were still
open at 9:00pm, and a few processed voters through midnight.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \label{fig:hist2012}
  \centering
    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{histogram_by_hour.pdf}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hist2012} displays the total number of voters who
voted early by the hour of the day at which they checked-in. Prior to
7:00pm, EViD check-ins were distributed fairly uniformly across the
day with a small peak before noon.  From 7:00am to 7:00pm, our
\numcounties\ counties consistently served around 70,000 Florida early
voters per hour. After 7:00pm, at which point new voters could not
join existing voting queues, the number of voters served per hour
dropped drastically---but not entirely.  A total of 84,112 early
voters in 2012 across our \numcounties\ counties cast ballots after
7:00pm. These are individuals who were in line at the time the polls
closed and were allowed to continue to wait to vote.  We know that all
of these voters had to wait in this way although we do not know
precisely how long each individual waited.  Of this group, 36,187
voted after 8:00pm.  These voters waited at least one hour to vote,
and 13,568 voters, who checked-in after 9:00pm, waited at least two
hours to vote.

    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{racial_composition.pdf}
\end{figure}

Aggregating across locations, Figure \ref{fig:race2012} describes the
composition of the 2012 early voting pool by race/ethnicity and hour
of check-in.  For most of the day, whites were the majority racial
group, followed by blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.  This ranking
reflects Florida's registered voter pool.  Among the 12,580,602
registered voters in the December 2012 Florida voter file,
approximately 66.4 percent are white, 13.9 percent Hispanic, 13.6
percent black, and 1.63 percent Asian.  As in years prior, blacks in
Florida in 2012 were disproportionate users of the state's early
voting period \citep{herronsmith:souls}.  What is striking in Figure
\ref{fig:race2012}, however, is the racial/ethnic composition of the
early voting pool immediately before and then after 7:00pm.  Simply
put, the pool becomes rapidly non-white starting around 7:00pm.  By
the 8:00pm-9:00pm window, the pool is less than 25 percent white.

The party registration of the early voting pool varies slightly with
time although not nearly as starkly as its racial/ethnic composition.
This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:party2012}, which describes by
hour the partisan breakdown of early voters in our \numcounties\
counties as well as the party breakdown of the four aforementioned
racial/ethnic groups.  While Democrats made up approximately 53\% of
all those who voted early in our \numcounties\ Florida counties, we
see from the black line in the figure that this percentage varied by
hour of the day.  Notably, Democrats composed a greater share of the
voters in both the early hours of voting and the hours after 7:00pm.
Hence, Democrats were disproportionately affected by voting lines that
forced voters to cast their ballots after 7:00pm.

Figure \ref{fig:party2012} describes the breakdown of party
registration by race/ethnicity, which reflects the aforementioned
racial/ethnic patterns of voting.  For example, black early voters in
Florida were almost entirely Democratic, regardless of when they
checked-in to vote.  Similarly, the party registration of Hispanic
voters---the least Democratic group in our \numcounties\
counties---remained relatively constant throughout the day.
However, there is a slight trend for white and Asian early voters, who
became increasingly likely to be registered Democratic as time
progressed.

\subsubsection*{Early voting in 2016}

By the time the 2016 General Election had occurred, Florida had
increased its number of early voting days from eight to 14, ostensibly
in an effort to reduce voting location congestion. Was this change
effective?  Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is analogous to the earlier
figure that described active early voting locations. Our \numcounties\
counties had 104XXXx early voting stations in place for the 2016 General
Election.

% > length(unique(evid16$location))

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    Election}
  \label{fig:nrlocs2016}
  \centering
    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{number_of_locations_2016.pdf}
\end{figure}

The most important aspect of Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is the
pictured dropoff in voter check-ins that occurred after 7:00pm. There
were indeed check-ins that took place after this time but not nearly
as many as in 2012. On the busiest day in 2012, more than half of the
polling locations were open past 9:00pm and more than five were open
past midnight. On the busiest day in 2016, only six locations were
open past 9:00pm and no early voter cast a ballot after 10:00pm.

In the introduction, we commented on improvements in voter wait times
that survey-based research designs have found in 2016 compared to
2012; indeed, and Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is consistent with
findings in the 2012 \citep{spae2012} and 2016 \citep{spae2016}
editions of the SPAE.  See Table \ref{tab:floridaspae}.  Early voting
in 2016---at least in our \numcounties\ Florida counties of
interest---represents an improvement over 2012 in terms of reducing
voting station congestion, which is presumably tied not only to the
expanded number of sites but also to the number of days and hours of
allowable early voting.\footnote{We say ``presumably'' here because of
  voter-level sorting that may affect the types of individuals in
  Florida who cast their ballots prior to a given Election Day.  When
  the Florida state legislature changed the state's early voting
  period between 2012 and 2016, voters may have altered their most
  preferred voting times.}

\subsubsection*{Late voting in 2012 versus 2016}

Figure \ref{fig:race2012and2016} provides a race/ethnicity-based
perspective on the 2012 versus 2016 comparison for our \numcounties\
counties.  For three key racial/ethnic groups in Florida---black,
Hispanic, and white---the figure shows the total number of check-ins
by time, aggregated across all days in the 2012 and 2016 early voting
periods.  Not only did more voters check-in for early voting in 2016
compared to 2012, fewer voters voted past 7:00pm. This is the case for
black, Hispanic, and white voters. We already have seen that non-white
early voters in Florida had disproportionately late check-ins in 2012,
but Figure \ref{fig:race2012and2016} shows how this problem did not
appear in 2016. There were slightly more non-whites with late
check-ins in this latter year, but the magnitude of the white versus
non-white gap shrunk in 2016 compared to 2012.

Even though 2016 attracted far more early voters than 2012, the
changes made to the early voting period appear to have reduced the
congestion outside of the polls. The increased number of days and
hours may have helped, as our \numcounties\ counties still served
roughly the same number of early voters per day in 2016 (approximately
128,253) as they did in 2012 (approximately 126,571). It is an open
question in the literature on election administration as to the
marginal effect of additional days versus hours per day on early
voting usage \citep[e.g.,][]{walkeretal:ncearly}.

\subsection*{Effects of waiting to vote}

We now consider the downstream effects on future electoral political
participation of waiting in line to vote. We focus first on the
consequences of waiting in an early voting line in the 2012 General
Election on turnout in the 2016 General Election. We then assess how
waiting in line in 2012 affected early voting in 2016. Lastly we
consider how waiting in 2012 was associated with turnout in 2014, the
year of a midterm election.

\subsubsection*{Effects of 2012 lines on 2016 turnout}

The challenges associated with assessing the effects of waiting to
vote in 2012 are twofold.  First, while we know voter check-in times
from our EViD data, the same cannot be said of voter arrival times,
which are not collected by election officials or anyone else for that
matter.  Indeed, were voter arrival times systematically tracked by
election administrators across the United States, there would be no
need for the research design employed here, much less national surveys
asking about wait times.  Second, early voters who voted at, say,
9:00am on a given day of early voting may be systematically different
from those who voted at 6:00pm. Consequently, estimating the effect of
voting after closing time---when we know voters must have waited in
line---is potentially confounded by voter-level selection.  Hence, we
need to ensure that we control for differences across early voters as
best as we can so that selection into time of early voting does not
confound our estimates of the effect of waiting in 2012 on future
turnout.

% Hence,
% distinguishing those early voters in 2012 who waited in line from
% those who did not is a challenge and requires an alternative method
% along with some assumptions.  


  % Thus, for any early voter in 2012 we can determine whether the
  % individual voted in the 2016 General Election, assuming that this
  % individual still lived in Florida as of November 2016 and was
  % registered in the state.

Our approach is as follows. We condition on county, race/ethnicity,
party registration, gender, age, neighborhood income, and previous
voting history, all of which are voter-level characteristics that we
know because EViD timestamps can be linked to Florida voter files.
And, we make the following assumption: individuals who voted at
Florida early voting locations which stayed open well past the 7:00pm
cutoff time are more likely to have waited in line than those who
voted in locations that closed before 7:00pm or at this time
exactly. Moreover, we assume that those who voted just before the
7:00pm cutoff in early voting locations that stayed open late are more
likely to have waited in line than those who voted earlier in the day.
We cannot know for sure if these assumptions hold, but there are
reasons to believe that they do.

Take, for example, the two polling locations in Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2012}.  The first location---the Karl County Center in
Hillsborough County---closed on time on November 3, 2012.  Therefore,
we assume that the Karl Center was not a congested polling location
and that the voters who voted just before 7:00pm did not have to wait
in much of a line.  If they did have to wait in line to vote, then the
line remarkably stopped just in time for the final early voter to
check-in right before 7:00pm.  While this is technically possible, it
would be remarkably coincidental.

On the other hand, the second location in Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2012}---the West Kendall Library in Miami-Dade
County---remained open until around 1:00am on November 3.  We know
with certainty that this last voter waited in line to vote.  In fact,
because all voters had to arrive before 7:00pm in order to check-in,
we know with certainty that he or she waited at least six hours to
vote.  Moreover, we can be fairly confident that the voters who voted
just before 7:00pm here also waited in line.  Voting that continues
past 7:00pm is indicative of a polling place that was operating
essentially at capacity at 7:00pm.  Hence, those voters who voted just
before 7:00pm are similarly likely to have been caught up in a long
voting line.

% With the above assumptions as background, we identify all voters who
% cast their ballots in early voting polling places that closed well past
% 7:00pm.  Thus, our estimates of the effects of voting lines depend on
% comparing voters who cast their ballots in places like the Karl County
% Center with voters who voted in places like the West Kendall Library.
% Moreover, individuals who voted closest to the 7:00pm cutoff since
% these are the individuals who we are most confident were affected by
% potential voting location congestion.
 
We create a variable, called \emph{Over}, that identifies all early
voters who voted at a polling location on a day where the last voter
checked-in past 7:30pm. We use this latter cutoff as opposed to 7:00pm
so that our results are conservative. Voters who cast ballots after
7:30pm did so at locations where we know that the voting line at the
end of the day was at least 30 minutes long. Then, we use a logistic
regression to estimate the effect of voting at a polling location that
was congested in 2012---one that went ``over'' 7:30pm---on the
probability of voting in 2016: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textup{Pr}\left(\mathrm{Voted16}_{i} = yes\right) =
    \textup{logit}^{-1}&(\beta + \eta_{County} + \alpha_{Over} + \gamma_{Hour} +
    \sigma_{Over \times Hour} + \upsilon_{Gender}  + \\& \rho_{Race/ethnicity} +
      \tau_{Age Group} + \psi_{Party} + \theta_{Income} + \pi_{Voted\emph{08}})
  \end{aligned}  
\end{equation*}
%
In the above model, $i$ denotes our collection of 2012 early voters
who appear in the history of Florida voting in 2008; $County$
indicates a voter's county; $Over$ indicates if the voter had to wait
in line in 2012; $Hour$ indicates the hour of the day in 2012 at which
a voter checked-in, between 7:00am and 7:00pm; $Gender$ indicates
whether the voter identifies as male or female; $Race/Ethnicity$
indicates if the voter self-identifies as white, black, Hispanic, or
Asian; $Age Group$ classifies voters according to their 2016 age and
bins them into 10-year age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69,
and 70+); $Party$ indicates party registration, either Democratic,
Republican, No party affiliation, or none of the above; $Income$
indicates log median household income in a voter's zip
code;\footnote{U.S.\ Census Bureau, 2010-2014 American Community
  Survey 5-Year Estimates} and, $Voted08$ and $Voted16$ are indicators
for participation in the 2008 and 2016 General Elections.

The covariates in our regression are based on findings in the
extensive literature on turnout in American elections. This literature
considers how age \citep{strateetal:age,hightonwolfinger:lifecycle},
gender \citep{schlozman:genderdifferentvoice}, party
\citep{martinezgill:partisanturnout,grofmanetal:turnout}, and race
\citep{verbaetal:raceparticipation,fraga:raceturnout} are associated
with individual-level turnout decisions. We estimate our logistic
regression using 809,914 individuals.\footnote{Our regression is
  estimated using individuals who voted before 7:00pm, who are
  registered either Democrat, Republican, or Independent, or have
  recorded no party affiliation, and who have recorded gender, race,
  and birthdate.}

Before turning to results, we consider whether our indicator variable
($Over$) for the presence of lines in voting locations is consistent
with aggregate features of our check-in data. If, using the 7:30pm
rule as noted above, the voting locations we identify as having been
affected by lines truly were busier than the locations where we
believe lines were not an issue, then we should observe greater
numbers of check-ins in the former compared to the latter. On this
point, see Figure \ref{fig:overplot}. This figure displays check-ins
per location, disaggregated by $Over$. What we see in the figure is
that, in every hour of the day, locations we believe had voting lines
were busier than locations where we do not believe lines were
prevalent.% This constitutes a consistency check for $Over$.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \caption{Check-ins per hour across congested and non-congested
    voting locations}
  \label{fig:overplot}
  \centering
    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 1.0]{over-plot.pdf}
\end{figure}

Turning now to regression results, coefficient estimates appear in
Table \ref{tab:reg} in the appendix. Per the leftmost column (1) of
Table \ref{tab:reg}, having voted in 2008 in Florida is positively
associated with subsequent voting in 2016, and being older is
associated with greater turnout, \emph{ceteris paribus}. The latter
result is consistent with findings on turnout and age
\citep{costaetal:walkingthewalk}. Our age estimates in Table
\ref{tab:reg} are presumably underestimated; the regression model that
generates them excludes the youngest voters in 2016, who could not
legally register to vote in Florida in 2008, and younger registered
voters are, \emph{ceteris paribus}, less likely to turn out to vote
\citep{shinosmith:registrationtiming}. Table \ref{tab:reg} also shows
that, \emph{ceteris paribus}, registered men vote less frequently than
women and that registered whites vote often than non-whites. This
gender finding is consistent with \citet{leighleynagler:whovotesnow}
although the race/ethnicity result is not.

Our objective is not to explore the relationship between demographic
covariates and voter turnout in Florida in 2016.  Rather, we want to
know the marginal effect of waiting in line on future turnout.  To
this end, Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2016} displays graphically the
probability of voting in 2016 of a black male between the ages of
50-60 who is a registered Democrat, voted in 2008, and lives in a
Hillsborough County zip-code with the average median household income.

Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2016} estimates are conditioned on each hour
of the early voting day in 2012. Its black points represent estimated
probabilities of voting in 2016 conditional on voting at a polling
location that closed \emph{before} 7:30pm; based on our discussion
above, these estimates reflect individuals who likely did not wait in
line.  In contrast, the grey points in Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2016}
are the estimated probabilities of voting in 2016 conditional on
casting an early ballot at a polling location that closed \emph{after}
7:30pm.  These estimates reflect individuals who likely did wait in
line to vote.  Hence, the difference between the figure's two sets of
estimates should reflect the effect of waiting in line.  Moreover, the
effect should be most isolated as one compares voters casting ballots
closer to 7:00pm.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\caption{Probability of voting in 2016, given 2012 check-in time}
  \label{fig:prvoting2016}
  \centering
    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{probability_of_voting_in_2016_over_under.pdf}
\end{figure}

Beginning at around 2:00pm, there is a small albeit negative
difference between individuals who voted in congested polling places
compared to those who cast their ballots in non-congested places.
This suggests that voting lines may have started in the early
afternoon, and the reason there is no difference between congested and
non-congested polling places earlier in the day may be because long
lines had yet to form then. As congested polling places become
congested, we begin to see a small but statistically significant
effect on future political participation, an effect which suggests
that voting lines slightly dampen future electoral participation.  The
effect is small, amounting to no more than roughly a percentage point
difference.

Voting probability plots for other demographic groups are similar to
the plot in Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2016}, and rather than showing
many such plots we generalize to our complete sample the marginal
effect of waiting in line in 2012 on voting in 2016.  Across our
sample, Figure \ref{fig:margfx2016} displays estimates, along with
95\% confidence intervals, of the change in probability of voting in
2016 based on time of early vote in 2012.  We generated the results in
the Figure \ref{fig:margfx2016} with a simulation.  Our simulation
(500 repetitions) drew from a multivariate normal distribution where
the mean vector consists of values of the coefficient vector
corresponding to the leftmost column (1) in Table \ref{tab:reg}.  The
covariance matrix for the multivariate normal is the estimated
covariance matrix from our logistic regression.  The numbers in Figure
\ref{fig:margfx2016} can be thought of as average treatment effects
where the treatment on individuals in our sample is being forced to
wait in a voting line in 2012.

  \label{fig:margfx2016}

    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{margfx_2016_vote.pdf}
\end{figure}


The point estimates in Figure \ref{fig:margfx2016} are all negative,
indicating that waiting in line in 2012 is associated with decreased
turnout probabilities in 2016.  The magnitudes of the estimated
probability differences range from almost zero associated with waiting
to vote at 7:00am to slightly over one percentage point later in the
day.

Overall, our findings on the effects of lines---they depress future
turnout, albeit only barely---are similar to the conclusions in
\citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts} wherein each hour an
in-person voter spends waiting in line to vote is associated with a
one percentage point drop in the likelihood of future turnout.  To the
best of our knowledge,
\citeauthor{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts} is the first scholar
to try to estimate the effect of waiting in line to vote on a later
propensity to vote, and our results are qualitatively similar to his.

Our regression results are based on individuals who were registered to
vote in Florida in 2008, 2012, and 2016.  Thus, our results exclude
the youngest registrants in Florida, who were not legally permitted to
be registered in Florida as of the 2008 General Election; individuals
who moved to Florida from out of state between the years of 2008 and
2016; registered Floridians who died, were convicted of committing a
felony, or adjudicated mentally incompetent between 2008 and 2016;
and, individuals who moved out of the state between 2008 and 2016.

In light of these issues, one might be concerned that, by selecting
against younger voters, we are biasing our estimates of waiting in
line in 2012 on turnout in 2016.  To this end, studies of the
willingness of individuals to leave emergency rooms without being seen
by medical professionals find that being young is a risk factor for
this behavior
\citep{sunetal:lwbs,clareycooke:emergencyroomleave,shaikh:howlongwaiter}.
In other words, young individuals seems unduly sensitive to wait
times.  If this is true, by excluding relatively younger voters in our
regression model, our estimates on the effect of waiting on future
election turnout are conservative.

Our regression analysis also selects against recent movers into or out
of Florida and individuals who became felons, and thus lost the right
to vote, between 2008 and 2016.  We do not know of any theoretical or
empirical reasons to think that these types of individuals are
systematically different in terms of sensitivity to voting lines.
However, conditioning our results on individuals who remained
registered to vote in Florida across a span of eight years presumably
means that we are conditioning our analysis on politically engaged
individuals.  This will again make our results on the effect of voting
lines on future turnout conservative.

% While there may be idiosyncrasies in the rates at which the above
% types of individuals vote---e.g., young voters tend to have
% disproportionately low turnout rates
% \citep{shinosmith:registrationtiming}---whether these types of
% individuals are unusually sensitive to lines is unclear.  


% Consider our exclusion of the youngest voters, and as context note
% that younger registered voters are \emph{ceteris paribus} less likely
% to turn out \cite{shinosmith:registrationtiming} than older
% counterparts.  If younger voters are more impatient then older
% voters, we will underestimate the effect of long lines on future
% turnout, to the extent younger voters were caught in lines in 2008 or
% 2012.  With respect to the other categories of excluded voters, it is
% difficult to imagine that they are have any systematic biases
% although, in principle, sensitivity to lines could be correlated with
% the willingness to live in Florida and thus to be listed in multiple
% voter files.

\subsubsection*{Effects of 2012 lines on 2016 early voting}

Now restricting attention to 2016 voters only, we consider a logistic
regression that analyzes whether these individuals voted early in
2016---or, in contrast, voted in another fashion.  \mbox{Results} are
in the second (2) column of Table \ref{tab:reg}, and Figure
\ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} contains a plot of 2016 early voting
probabilities structured similarly as our earlier turnout probability
plot.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \caption{The effect of waiting in line to vote in 2012 on voting early in 2016}
  \label{fig:atevotingearly2016}
  \centering\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{margfx_2016_vote_early.pdf}
\end{figure}

Intuitively, and to the extent that time spent in line increases the
cost of voting, we would expect that waiting in an early voting line
in 2012 is associated with a decreased likelihood of voting early in
2016.  Indeed, Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} shows that the 2016
voters whom we identify as having waited in an early voting line in
2012 were less like to vote early in 2016, \emph{ceteris paribus}.
This result shows how some voters responded to high costs of early
voting by choosing an alternative way to vote in a later election, and
this highlights a downstream consequence of voting lines.  Still,
Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016}'s percentage point gaps (black dot
to grey dot) are around two to three points, which is small albeit not
negligible.  Early voting was designed as a convenience, and Figure
\ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} suggests that the value of this
convenience can be lost in the shadow of a previous bad experience.

% There is a perhaps a U-shape pattern to the points in Figure
% \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016}, and we can only speculate as to what may
% be responsible for this. We know from the number of post-7:00pm
% closing times that, in 2012, early voting locations in our
% \numcounties\ counties of interest were congested in the evening. We
% suspect that morning early voting hours also suffered from congestion
% albeit from a different source, perhaps when individuals stopped by to
% vote before going to work. If lines discourage future early voting,
% this pattern would yield a U-shape as in Figure
% \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016}. It is also interesting to note that
% early voters in 2012 who voted at locations that closed before 7:30pm
% also have a U-shape in their early voting probabilities. We suspect
% this is because these locations probably suffered from morning and
% evening lines, albeit not very long ones.

% \footnote{This discussion
%   suggests that employed individuals may be disproportionately
%   sensitive to waiting in line to vote, and this would be consistent
%   with the relationship between affluence and tolerance for waiting in
%   a supermarket line \citep[e.g.,][]{bennett:waitinginlinechars}.
%   There is no employment data in Florida statewide voter files, but a
%   relationship between work opportunities and one's willingness to
%   wait in line is worth considering in future research.}

A full analysis of the determinants of what leads individuals to cast
votes early is beyond our scope.  However, what is most important
about Figure \ref{fig:atevotingearly2016} is that it highlights how
voting experiences can affect forms of future political participation.
Wanting to voting early, but not doing so on account of fear of lines,
imposes a cost on voters, and future research on election
administration needs to pay attention to the way that electoral
experiences, both positive and negative, can accumulate over time and
potentially affect future choices.

\subsubsection*{Effects of 2012 lines on 2014 turnout}

Our final set of results on the effects of lines considers turnout in
the 2014 General Election as a function of line waiting in 2012.  Our
consideration of 2014 reflects the possibility that the effect of
waiting in line attenuates in time (because bad memories of line
waiting become less salient, for example).  If this is true, we would
expect to see greater consequences of waiting in line in 2012 on 2014
turnout compared to 2016 turnout. 

Nonetheless, one drawback of analyzing 2014 turnout based on 2012
voting experiences is the fact that the 2014 statewide election in
Florida was a midterm election as opposed to a presidential election.
As midterms are generally less attractive to voters as the stakes are
ostensibly lower in the former, a negative voting experience in 2012
might be sufficient to discourage a voter from turning out to vote in
2014 when such an experience might not have been enough to discourage
that same voter from voting in the presidential election in 2016.
Hence, having to wait in line to vote in 2012 may cause a more
profound reduction in turnout in 2014 compared to 2016.  On the other
hand, midterm electorates may be more energized and politically
engaged than presidential electorates, the latter of which attract all
sorts of voters on account of the perceived high stakes.  As a result,
a negative experience waiting in line in 2012 might not be enough to
deter an already motivated midterm voter.  If this is the case, we
might expect to see smaller effects of 2012 lines on 2014 turnout
compared to 2016 turnout.

% Per the above, there are limitations inherent in our consideration of
% 2014 turnout as a function of 2012 line experiences.  In an
% observational study like ours, these limitations are unavoidable, and
% we note them in the interest of transparency.

%in particular
%if their Election Day polling place is relocated \cite{amos_etal2017}.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \caption{The effect of waiting in line to vote in 2012 on turnout in 2014}
  \centering\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{margfx_2014_vote.pdf}
  %\caption{Turnout in 2014}
  \label{fig:prvoting2014}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:prvoting2014} presents estimates of the effect of
having waited in line to vote in 2012 on the probability of turning
out to vote in the 2014 midterm election. What is most noticeable
about this figure is that the downstream effect of having waited in
line in 2012 appears much stronger in 2014 than in 2016. Individuals
who voted in congested polling locations in 2012 were between 2.5 and
4.5 percentage points less likely to vote in 2014 compared to those
who voted in polling locations that were not so congested in 2012. In
2016, those same individuals were between zero and 1.25 percentage
points less likely to vote. This suggests that negative voting
experiences in 2012 were more profound in altering midterm turnout
than they were in altering turnout in a subsequent presidential
election.

In the analyses that we have described, the effects of waiting to vote
on 2014 turnout and on 2016 turnout are conditional on the hour in
which a voter voted in 2012.  We have found that early voters who cast
their ballots in the afternoon in 2012 were more affected by congested
polling locations than voters who cast their ballots before noon.
Although a so-called afternoon effect is more pronounced in 2016, we
observe as well that, in 2014, the magnitude of the effect of line
waiting on turnout increases between noon and 3:00pm and then
gradually returns to before-noon levels for voters who voted just
before the 7:00pm cutoff.  While it is unclear why the effect of lines
is strongest regarding 2014 turnout just before 3:00pm, we note that
there is a slight conditional effect of time from 2012 and that this
effect is outweighed by a much stronger effect of having voted in a
congested precinct.

% \footnote{An interesting question for
%   future research is the extent to which bad experiences via voting
%   lines compound over time or cancel themselves out.  We do not at
%   present have data that would allow us to analyze the 2016 turnout
%   decisions of, say, individuals who experienced a long line in 2012
%   but no line in 2014.}

% \subsection*{A comment on our key assumption}

% What if we are wrong that early voting locations in Florida that in
% 2012 closed after 7:30pm were not congested? If so, then we have
% confused congested early voting locations with non-congested locations
% and presumably vice versa. This will make it difficult for us to
% estimate the effect of an hour of waiting on future turnout. Our
% assumption about late-closing early voting locations is thus
% conservative, and we note that we have found significant, albeit
% small, effects on future turnout of voters having cast their ballots
% in voting locations that we identified as closing late.

\section*{Conclusion}



% The extent to which all voters in an election are treated equally
% depends in part on whether the cost of voting in the election is
% distributed uniformly across voters. Administrative aspects of
% elections that affect the cost of voting are thus part of the overall
% calculus of whether an election was characterized by equal treatment
% or the lack thereof.  A notable administrative aspect of elections is
% the presence of voting lines, and 

Lengthy voting lines in the United States have been of concern to
scholars, election officials, policy makers, and voters. Burdensome
wait times not only impose opportunity costs on those forced to wait
in line but can also discourage future electoral
participation. Research on voting lines has historically been
challenged by the lack of data on who waits to vote. Other than noting
the times at which polls officially closed and recording information
about which voters cast their ballots after voting lines were capped,
there is little data collected by election officials that might
distinguish those who waited in line to vote from those who did not
(not to mention individuals who waited in a voting line but departed
without casting a ballot).  Notwithstanding a limited number of
exceptions, local election officials do not maintain official records
on line evolution or how long individual voters waited
\citep{herron:confidence}.

% Previous research using election
% records to study lines have thus been limited to examining variables
% like aggregate precinct results
% \citep[e.g.,][]{herronsmith:closingtimes,
%   pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}.  Data limitations have
% prevented these projects from identifying individuals who waited in
% line from those who did not \emph{within} the same precinct.

Scholars interest in lines have traditionally relied on surveys that
ask respondents to recall their experiences at the polls and report
the length of time that they waited prior to voting. Survey-based
analyses have illuminated important variation in wait times across
geographies and racial/ethnic groups, but associated with them is the
caveat that survey responses are subject to biases associated with
self-reporting. While we do not believe that scholars should eschew
voter self-reports of time spent in lines, we nonetheless argue that
research depending on voter self-reports of time-based experiences
should be cognizant of findings in the literature on memory
distortion, several of which we noted earlier.


% To wit, the existing literature on voting lines relies heavily on
% voter self-reports of time spent in line.  Despite research on memory
% distortion, this literature assumes that voters can accurately recall
% and report in a recent election how long they waited prior to
% voting. In contrast, nothing in the results reported on here requires
% voters to have accurate recollections of any aspects of their voting
% experiences.  


Our contribution to the literature on voting lines analyzes early
voter check-in times in Florida's 2012 and 2016 General Elections.
Using electronic voting check-in time stamps from Alachua, Broward,
Hernando, Hillsborough, Levy, Miami-Dade, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach,
and Putnam counties, we identify the day and time at which over two
million voters checked-in to vote.  Voter check-in times are not a
panacea in the quest to understand voting lines and their
consequences, and this is because these times do not specify when
voters arrived to cast their ballots. Using check-ins in a line study
such as ours thus requires assumptions, and our key assumption is that
late-closing (after 7:30pm) early voting precincts in Florida in 2012
were different, and in particular were more congested than,
non-late-closing precincts. Our check-in times are roughly consistent
with this assumption. Still, until voter arrival times are tracked as
systematically as check-in times, studies of voting lines will be
forced to confront the data limitations that bedevil the research
described here.

Our analysis reveals that Florida's early voting period in 2012 had a
significant number of voters who voted past the official 7:00pm
closing time and, therefore, must have waited in line to vote.  These
voters were disproportionately black, Hispanic, and Democratic---a
finding that coincides with survey results on voting lines.  In 2016,
we find that congestion observed in 2012 had all but vanished.  Voters
rarely voted late into the night in 2016, and most early voting
locations in our Florida counties of interest closed promptly.  Even
though the counties we study in 2016 served as many individual per day
as they had in 2012, they appear to have been more prepared to handle
the high rates of early voting.
  
We also estimated the effect that waiting in line in 2012 had on future
electoral participation, i.e., on voting in 2014 and in 2016.  We
found a very slight negative effect of 2012 line waiting on turnout in
2016, an effect amounting to no more than a one percentage point
decrease in the propensity to vote. The result is similar to that
identified by \citet{pettigrew:racegapwaittimes}.  A one percentage
point effect is small in magnitude, which is normatively pleasing, but
any negative effect or lines on future turnout is normatively
troubling.  In 2014, a midterm election year, we find larger effects
of 2012 line waiting on turnout.  Thus, not only are some voters
penalized by waiting in line, but a small number of these individuals
appear to be dissuaded from voting in the future, thus lessening their
voices.

% We offered evidence as well that long early voting lines dissuade
% voters from casting early ballots.  To the extent that early voting is
% a form of convenience voting, this result shows how the value of this
% convenience can be compromised by long lines, something that most
% observers would classify as administrative failures.


% As
% such, our our analysis of check-in times should be viewed as a
% complement to studies using survey and other observational methods to
% explain who waits in line and for how long.


Overall, our evidence shows that the 2012 General Election in Florida
did not treat all voters equally.  Minority voters in 2012 voters
faced disproportionately long lines---thus, disproportionately high
costs of voting---and then, in some cases, a small downstream effect
in 2014 and 2016 of a decreased propensity to vote.  Our results
illustrate how administrative aspects of elections, in particular,
resource allocation decisions that affect whether an election will
have lines at the polls or not, should not only be understood as
administrative in nature, but also as indicative of the underlying
fairness of the electoral process and the extent to which all voters
are treated equally under the law.

% Except for the few states that require voters to cast ballots by mail
% (or use drop off boxes), waiting to vote at the polls is likely to
% continue to be an inevitable part of the voting experience for voters
% in certain jurisdictions. Long lines may result in some voters not
% only having to pay a time tax, but they may also serve as a deterrent
% on future voting for some citizens. In Florida, the expansion of the
% number of days, hours, and locations of early voting between the 2012
% and 2016 General Elections likley helped to alleviate some of the
% dealys experienced by those voters who chose to voter during the early
% voting period, especially those casting ballots late in the day.
% Further research needs to be conducted on how such delays at the polls
% may affect future turnout decisions.
