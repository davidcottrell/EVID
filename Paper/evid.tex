\section*{Introduction}

The majority---over 75\% in 2016---of voters in the United States who
cast ballots in presidential elections do so in-person, either on an
Election Day itself or during a corresponding early voting period
whose duration depends on relevant state or local laws.\footnote{For
  details on this figure and the composition of the 2016 electorate,
  see \citet{eac:2016}} As opposed to voting remotely via mail,
casting a ballot in-person requires traveling to a voting location,
which is often called a precinct; possibly spending time in a line
prior to voting; authenticating oneself in some fashion to election
officials; physically registering candidate and ballot measure
preferences; and, submitting a ballot for tabulation.  An in-person
voting experience thus has a number of facets whose precise nature
depends on local conditions, and our interest here is the second of
the steps noted above, namely, the act of waiting in line before being
processed to vote.

%% 2016 EAC is from p. 10

We draw attention to two important features of voting lines, by which
we mean lines that form \emph{in front of} precincts as opposed to
lines in which voters, already in the act of casting ballots, are
forced to stand.  First, waiting in line to vote constitutes a time
tax \citep{mukherjee:timetax}.  This tax can be negligible---for
example, a voter waits a scant number of seconds prior to initiating
her voting process---or imposing---some of the Florida voters we
describe shortly waited several hours to vote in 2012.  Associated
with a voting line time tax are the distributional questions
associated with all forms of taxation: is the time tax fair and, in
particular, is the burden of this tax spread uniformly across voters
or concentrated on certain types of individuals?

Second, waiting in line is an experience that in principle can have 
``downstream'' effects, as characterized by
\citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}. When an individual is
compelled to pay a relatively high tax in order to participate in a
social or political activity, a natural response might be to avoid the
activity, or substitute for it, in the future. To make matters
concrete, if a line in front of a particular restaurant is long, some
individuals may substitute an alternative eatery for the restaurant in
question, one without an imposing line.\footnote{Alternatively, a line
  in front of a restaurant might be a quality signal, in which case
  the presence of a line might be an incentive to eat at said
  restaurant.}  While it is not \emph{a priori} clear that voting is
substitutable in the way that selecting a restaurant might be, we
should not dismiss outright the possibility that the effect of waiting
in line to vote, which raises the cost of voting, might decrease the
likelihood of voting in the future.  Given the relatively low rate of
voter participation in American presidential elections
\citep{IDEA:turnout}, any aspect of the voting experience that might
have a depressive effect on turnout should be considered a matter
worthy of study.

These two features of voting lines---time tax and potential downstream
consequences---are conceptually distinct. The time tax for voting
could be uniformly spread across voters, which might be normatively
pleasing, and yet there could be a significant effect of waiting in
line on future electoral participation, which might be less so. Or,
the time tax could be concentrated on certain types of voters, which
most would argue is not fair regardless of whether there are
downstream consequences of waiting to vote. With this in mind, our
analysis here of voting lines during early in-person voting periods in
Florida is divided into two sections. The first addresses
questions---who has to wait?  do all voters have equal waiting
times?---associated with the notion of waiting in line as a time tax,
and the second considers the consequences---do individuals who waited
to vote have lower turnout rates in the future?---of this tax.

One of the difficulties in studying voting lines in the United States
is data availability: it is not easy to determine precisely how long
voters waited in line at the polls.  It is accordingly difficult to
study if there are consequences for subsequent voting behavior of
waiting in line.  Some researchers have dealt with this hurdle by
using surveys---either Election Day exit polls or post-election
questionnaires---which integrate responses to waiting time questions
with other survey items, namely socioeconomic and partisan queries
\citep{stewart:waitingtovote2012}.  Post-election surveys on voting
experiences can foster access to wide swaths of voters, and this is
valuable.  A limitation of surveys regarding electoral experiences,
though, is that they rely on self-reports of wait times, which may not
be accurate, and in addition it is known that self-reporting of
turnout in general can suffer from over-reporting
\citep{karpbrockington:overreport,bellietal:overreport}.

In light of potential concern with survey-based evidence on voting
lines, we turn here to a relatively untapped source of information on
lines, namely, voter check-in times. Specifically, we draw on data
collected by several Florida counties that recorded check-in times
from early voting sites in the 2012 and 2016 General Elections.  As
will be clear shortly, the hundreds of thousands of check-in times
which form the basis of our research are not subject to biases
involving voluntary self-reporting.  This is advantageous, as is our
ability to link a voter's check-in time with her race/ethnicity, party
registration, and electoral participation history, all of which are
part of every Florida voter's registration file.  However, in the
interests of being transparent about limitations in our research
design, a voter's check-in time is not directly connected to the amount
of time she spent waiting in line.  We describe below how we associate
voter check-in times with corresponding waiting times, but the
connection is not perfect.  Our use of early voting check-in times
thus complements the literature's reliance on survey data, and we
believe that researchers engaged in election administration projects
benefit when multiple sources of data are used in line-based research.

Briefly, our results are as follows.  Regarding the time tax
associated with waiting to vote, we find disproportionate
concentration of this tax on minority voters.  The situation was worse
in Florida in 2012 than in 2016, and in general our collection of
check-in times highlights fewer troubling issues in the latter.  This
is consistent with national, survey-based evidence on voting lines in
the 2012 and 2016 General Elections.\footnote{For a national 2012
  versus 2016 comparison, see
  \url{http://electionupdates.caltech.edu/2016/12/14/this-just-in-lines-at-the-polls-shorter-in-2016-than-in-2012}
  (last accessed March 30, 2017), as well as
  \url{http://www.richmond.com/opinion/their-opinion/guest-columnists/fortier-and-palmer-column-who-waits-the-longest-to-vote/article_81efabad-aa23-577b-83d1-0e524cf844ef.html}
  (last accessed June 30, 2017).}  Whether the recent decrease in
waiting times reflects progress in Florida election administration,
substitution effects and voter sorting, or idiosyncrasies from either
the 2012 or 2016 General Election is not clear.  Two election-years of
data are unlikely to be sufficient to gauge broad progress in a state
as large and heterogeneous as Florida.

Regarding the effect of waiting to vote on future electoral
participation, conditional on our strategy for identifying those
Florida early voters who suffered long waits in 2012, we find small
yet negative consequences regarding turnout in 2016. The consequences
are not completely negligible insofar as long lines do appear to be
associated with lower participation levels; they are, however, small,
and this is consistent with
\citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}.  Our results have both
positive and normative implications, and we discuss these at length in
the conclusion.

The next section situates our study in the literature on voting lines
and election administration.  We then turn to early voting check-in
times in Florida and explain what these times mean and how they can be
interpreted.  Our results, which leverage check-in times, are divided
into two sections: first we describe the distribution of the voting
time tax across our set of Florida voters, and second we analyze the
downstream effects of the tax.  The last section concludes.

\section*{Voting lines in American elections}

``To me,'' Cynthia Perez complained in March 2016 after seeing a long
line wending its way around an early voting center in Maricopa County,
Arizona, with those in line reporting standing in line for more than
three hours before checking in to vote, ``this is not what democracy
is about.''\footnote{This quote is drawn from ``Angry Arizona Voters
  Demand: Why Such Long Lines at Polling Sites?'' \emph{The New York
    Times}, March 24, 2016, available at
  \url{https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/us/angry-arizona-voters-demand-why-such-long-lines-at-polling-sites.html}
  (last accessed July 17, 2017)} Ahead of the state's 2016
presidential primary, election administrators in Maricopa County had
cut the number of Election Day polling places by roughly 70 percent,
which put greater strain on early voting centers. Voters in a handful
of states also experienced long lines in the 2016 General Election,
but this was nothing compared to what transpired four years earlier in
Florida.  In 2011, the Florida state legislature curtailed the state's
early voting period, which, as some observers had expected, resulted
in long lines for many electors who tried to vote in person during the
truncated early voting period in the 2012 General Election
\citep{herron_smith2014}.  Following the election and the seemingly
inevitable anger over long waits at the polls, then-United States
President Barack Obama formed a Presidential Commission in early 2013
to address general election administrative issues in the United
States.  In doing so, he highlighted the plight of 102-year old
Desiline Victor, a Haitian-American woman who on October 27, 2012,
waited in line for nearly four hours at Florida's North Miami Public
Library early voting center.  Not surprisingly, Obama's Presidential
Commission devoted some of its January, 2014, report to long lines,
concluding that, ``[A]s a general rule, no voter should have to wait
more than half an hour in order to have an opportunity to vote''
\citep[p.\ 13,][]{pcea:2014}.\footnote{The executive order creating
  this commission is available at

\subsection*{Survey data in election line research}

These anecdotes are striking, and they raise questions about voting
lines in general---in particular, how long voters have to wait, how
much variance there is across the United States in waiting times, and
what consequences lines have, if any, beyond the cost of standing in
line.

With few exceptions \citep[e.g.,][]{spencermarkovits:renege,
  herronsmith:hanoverstudy, pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts},
much of what we know about congestion at the polls and associated wait
times for voters is derived from survey data. Most notably,
\citet{stewart:waitingtovote2012} and his coauthors have conducted
post-election, Internet-based surveys in the United States following
the last three general elections.  These surveys query voters about
their experiences at the polls, and the surveys include items on
estimated wait times.  \citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012}'s
\emph{Survey of the Performance of American Elections} (SPAE), which
surveys 200 individuals in each state and Washington, D.C., along with
the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), have been used to
gauge relative wait times across states the as well as overall wait
times for different sub-populations of voters.  According to
\citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012}, wait times across the United
States vary considerably, but a state's average wait time tends to be
consistent over time.

Surveys relying on self-reported wait times can serve as valuable
barometers for gauging both individual-level and regional
distributions of voting delays.  For a decade, Floridians have
consistently reported having to endure some of the longest wait times
in the country. In the 2012 General Election, for example, in-person
voters reported on average waiting 39 minutes to cast a ballot, three
times the national average \citep{stewart:waitingtovote2012}.  Surveys
like the SPAE can help identify when during the voting process wait
times are most likely to occur.  In the 2012 General Election,
\citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012} documented that over
three-fifths of early in-person voters nationwide who reported waiting
in line to vote said their wait was primarily during the check-in
stage.

Surveys are also helpful when trying to tease out the possibility of
differential voting line time taxes across sub-populations of voters.
Drawing on 2008 CCES data, \cite{mukherjee:timetax} finds minority
voters were more likely, relative to White voters, to pay such a tax
when queuing to vote. \citet{kimball:voting}, using the 2012 SPAE,
reports that voters in urban areas faced longer lines than rural
voters, and \citet{pettigrew:racegapwaittimes} estimates that
typically non-white voting locations in the United States were
associated with voter wait times approximately twice as long as those
in white locations.  \cite{herron:confidence} use exit polls in
Miami-Dade in 2014 to gauge the polling place experiences of voters
leaving polling stations.  In his study of the 2012 General Election,
which builds on the 2008 General Election research design of
\citet{alvarez:survey}, \cite{stewart:waitingtovote2012} finds that a
voter's race/ethnicity is an important ``individual-level
demographic'' that explains disparate wait times.  ``African Americans
waited an average of 23 minutes to vote,''
\citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012} found, ``compared to only 12
minutes for Whites; Hispanics reported waiting 19 minutes, on
average.''  \citeauthor{stewart:waitingtovote2012} concluded that
these differences in wait times could be ``due to factors associated
with where minority voters live, rather than with minority voters as
individuals'' (pp.\ 457-458).

As we mentioned briefly in the introduction, there are several
limitations with survey data when used to estimate voter wait times at
the polls. First, surveys by construction draw on voter self-reports.
There are a variety of reasons that respondents might not recall
accurately how long they waited in line before voting
\citep[e.g.,][]{sackettetal:timeflies}, and social desirability may
confound accurate reporting on what has become a controversial, and at
times political, issue.  Second, surveys often do not distinguish
among the various wait times that voters may experience when parking,
queuing up to check-in, filling out ballots, or processing completed
ballots. Third, not all surveys have access to tens of thousands of
respondents.  Given variability across states and even local
jurisdictions in election administration practices, national surveys
may not be not particularly well-suited for assessing variation in
wait times across polling places within a state.

\subsection*{Moving beyond voter line surveys}

In light of limitations with survey data, our approach to the voting
lines draws on an alternative source of information: check-in times of
voters in Florida who cast their ballots at early in-person polling
sites prior to the 2012 and 2016 General Elections.  In 2016, more
Florida voters---3.88 million---cast early in-person ballots than
voters who mailed in their absentee ballots (2.76 million) or who
voted in person at their local Election Day precincts (2.96 million)
\citep{FDOS:2016vote}. The prevalence of early in-person voting is not
unique to Florida. Across the United States, early voting is
increasingly popular, and for analyses of early voting reforms and
their consequences see \citet{neelyrichardson:earlyvoting},
\citet{gronke:2012}, \citet{gronke:earlyvotingreforms},
\citet{gronketoffey:psychological}, \citet{gronkebaum:growth}, and
\citet{burdenetal:unanticipated}.  Although there are debates in the
literature about the extent to which early voting has changed the
electorate, if at all, here we take this mode of voting as
given. 

Florida notwithstanding, there is good reason to focus on wait times
during early in-person voting.  Michael P.\ McDonald, on his Election
Project website, estimates that over 23 million voters cast early
in-person ballots in ``advance'' of the November 8, 2016, General
Election, some 17 percent of the 137 million votes cast.\footnote{The
  2016 estimates are drawn from
  \url{http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data}
  (last accessed March 31, 2017).}  If one were to be concerned that
our focus on early voters in Florida limits our scope, these
statistics imply that our results apply to millions of Americans.

Florida's open records laws make the state an excellent laboratory for
the study of election administration, including wait times. For
example, in their study of congestion at the polls in Florida in the
2012 General Election, \cite{herronsmith:closingtimes} obtained
precinct-level data detailing when the last voter in a precinct
checked in to vote, when the final voter in a precinct cast a ballot,
or when the last voting optical scan machine in a precinct was shut
down. They find significant differences in the closing times of
precincts within counties, contingent on a precinct's racial and
ethnic composition.  In addition, Florida's laws provide a wealth of
information not only about who votes, but when and how voters cast
ballots.  Drawing on publicly available voter demographic and vote
history data in Florida, \cite{amos_etal2017} find differences in
individual-level turnout across political party and racial and ethnic
categories among registered voters whose precincts were eliminated or
relocated by local election administrators.  Similarly, by linking
multiple statewide voter files and individual-level early voting
files, \cite{herron_smith2014} are able to demonstrate how reductions
in the number of early voting days following the 2008 General Election
are associated with a drop in early voting in 2012, especially among
minority voters who had cast ballots on the final Sunday of early
voting in 2008, a day of early voting that was eliminated by the state
legislature ahead of the 2012 election.

When it comes to direct election monitoring, however, Florida grants
considerable privacy to voters.  With the exception of those serving
as candidate, political party, or ballot issue representatives, state
law prohibits precinct observers from tracking voting processes inside
a polling place when votes are actively being cast. This effectively
precludes scholars who want to understand why lines form in front or
inside Florida precincts from replicating observational studies of
voter activities in the vein of
\possessivescite{spencermarkovits:renege}'s study of California and
\possessivecite{herronsmith:hanoverstudy}'s research on New Hampshire.

\section*{Florida early voting check-in times}

Election administration in the Sunshine State---from registering
voters, to determining precinct sizes, to staffing and locating
polling places, and to setting early voting days and hours---is
largely controlled at the county level within a framework established
by the Florida state legislature. The primary data source in our
analysis is thus gleaned from Florida counties, and it consists of
early voting check-in times across early voting polling stations
during the 2012 and 2016 General Elections.  We now explain what these
times represent.

In 2012, all 67 of Florida's counties offered between six and 12 daily
hours of early voting over an eight-day period (Saturday through
Saturday) that ended immediately prior to the General Election,
November 6, 2012.  In 2016, after long-lines in 2012 had apparently
convinced the state legislature to grant counties more flexibility in
offering early voting opportunities, counties were permitted to offer
up to 12 hours of early voting per day, spread over 14 days, ending
the final Sunday before the November 8, 2016, General Election.
Counties were permitted to offer a maximum of 168 total hours of early
voting.\footnote{See Florida Governor Rick Scott's statement, issued
  in the aftermath of the 2012 General Election, available at
  \url{http://www.flgov.com/2013/01/17/governor-rick-scott-statement-on-election-reforms/}
  (last accessed March 31, 2017).}

A Florida voter who wishes to cast his or her ballot early may vote at
any early voting polling location in the county in which he or she is
registered.  This is distinct from in-person, Election Day voting,
during which a registered Florida vote must vote at his or her
assigned precinct.  Rather than relying on traditional, paper-based
pollbooks to check-in voters in local precincts, as is the case on
Election Day in some Florida counties, the 67 county Supervisors of
Elections in Florida use electronic pollbooks to check-in voters
during the state's early voting period.  These pollbooks are for the
most part known as Electronic Voter iDentification machines, or EViDs
for short.  Although there is variance across Florida counties in
electronic pollbook implementation, for simplicity we refer to all
electronic pollbooks as EViD machines.\footnote{For example, Sarasota
  County uses a different electronic voting system for its early
  voters (phone call with Cathy Fowler, office of the Sarasota
  Supervisor of Elections, on March 31, 2017).}

%% Cathy Fowler:  cfowler@sarasotavotes.com

EViD machines allow county pollworkers to check-in and verify the
registration statuses and identities of voters casting early,
in-person ballots. The EViD system is designed to reduce the time it
takes to process early voters, and it fosters synchronization across a
county's early voting centers as well as with the Florida statewide
voter database.  This can thwart potential double-voting.  More
importantly for our purposes, EViD machines clock the check-in times
for all early voters, providing us with effective timestamps that
specify when a voter began his or her voting process. EViD timestamps
are recorded to the minute, and this allows us, for example, to
pinpoint early voters who had not checked-in when polls closed at
7:00pm on a given day of early voting but nonetheless cast ballots.
Per Florida state law, any elector in line at 7:00pm is allowed to
cast a ballot \citet{FLStatutes:7pm}.

EViD timestamps are not subject to potential self-reporting biases and
hence are presumably more accurate than surveys of voter times or even
within-polling place observations of when voters checked-in.
Moreover, EViD timestamps include Florida voter identification
numbers, which we can directly link to the nearly 14 million
individual voter registration records in Florida's statewide voter
file.  To this end, we merge our EViD with statewide voter files that
cover the 2012 and 2016 General Elections. \footnote{ We recorded 942,242 
early voters across the six counties in 2012 and 1,687,304 early voters across those
same counties in 2016.   Of those 2012 early voters, 40,455 could not be matched
to the registration records we have from the January 2014 voter extract file. 
Of those 2016 early voters, 969 could not be matched
to the registration records we have from the January 2016 voter extract file. 
In any analysis that uses demographic or partisan information about the voters,
we drop those voters who could not be matched to registration records.}

Despite their advantages, EViD check-in times are not a panacea in the
quest to understand voting lines and their consequences.  We
ultimately care about voter wait times, and in this sense our use of
EViD check-in times has limitations.  An individual check-in time
indicates when a given voter finished waiting in a line, if there were
a line to begin with.  However, such a time does not specify how long
an individual waited to vote, if at all. As such, our analysis of
check-in times serves as a complement to studies using survey and
other observational methods to explain who waits in line and for how
long.

Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} displays the distribution of EViD check-in
times on the last Saturday (November 3) of the 2012 General Election
early voting period for two different polling locations in Florida,
one at the Fred B.\ Karl County Center in Hillsborough County and the
other at the West Kendall Regional Library in Miami-Dade County.  The
histograms in this figure describe in ten minute blocks the number of
voters who checked into these two polling stations.  The counts begin
with the first voter who checked-in just as polls opened at 7:00am,
and they end with the last voter who checked-in (regardless of whether
this individual checked-in before or after the official 7:00pm

\end{figure}

Several features of Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} are notable.  First,
both panels in the figure contain horizontal red lines at 7:00pm.
This is the time beyond which additional voters were not allowed to
join a (possibly existing) voting line.  In the Hillsborough County
location (Figure \ref{fig:karlexample}), no check-ins occurred after
7:00pm, and from this it follows that, at 7:00pm, where was no voting
line.  In contrast, the Miami-Dade location (Figure
\ref{fig:kendallexample}) had many post-7:00pm check-ins, the last one
of which occurred around 1:00am on Sunday, November 4.  This time is
noted with a dashed red line.  We thus know that the last-voting voter
at West Kendall Regional Library waited at least almost six hours to
vote.

Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} also includes information on voter
self-reported race/ethnicity, and racial/ethnic details are depicted via bar colors.
Early voters at the Fred B.\ Karl County Center were primarily white,
although there were periods on November 3 when the fraction of
non-white votes was disproportionately high, e.g., toward the end of
the day.  At the West Kendall Regional Library, though, the vast
majority of early voters were non-white.  The fraction of non-white
voters appears roughly consistent across November 3.

Lastly, and very roughly speaking, we observe a flatter or
more-uniform distribution of check-in times at Fred B.\ Karl County
Center than in West Kendall Regional Library.  We will draw on this
fact later, when we try to determine which voters waited in line, and
here we provide some intuition.  Overall, and as illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:tenminhist}, it appears that early voting locations in
Florida that shut down very late had flatter distributions of check-in
times.  We suspect that this is evidence of persistent lines.  In
contrast, the non-uniformity of check-in times that we observe in
Figure \ref{fig:karlexample} is consistent with more of an ebb and
flow of early voters.  We know that there was not a line to vote at
Fred B.\ Karl County Center at 7:00pm on Saturday, November 3, this
despite the fact that, per check-in times, the Center was regularly
processing voters.

Figure \ref{fig:tenminhist} highlights the value of EViD check-in
times (timestamps, association with race/ethnicity, and so forth) as well as
their limitations (check-ins are not linked to arrivals).  All data
sources have advantages and disadvantages, and we will draw on the
former and attempt to work with the latter as we turn to results.

\section*{Results}

We present results in two sections.  First, we describe patterns in
check-in times across the 2012 and 2016 General Elections with
particular attention to race/ethnicity and partisanship.  Second we consider the
consequences of extensive early voting wait times based on a
identifying assumption we use to characterize individuals who waited
before voting.

\subsection*{Who waits?}

The election participation history data included in Florida statewide
voter files do not contain EViD check-in times.  For these times we
have to rely on public records requests made to individual county
Supervisors of Elections.

\subsubsection*{Early voting in 2012}

For the 2012 General Election, we have been able to obtain 2012 EViD
check-in data from six Florida counties: Alachua, Broward,
Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, and Palm Beach.  Altogether these
counties had 78 total early voting locations---akin to precincts,
except that voters in a given county may cast early ballots in the
county---that serviced a total of 942,194 voters in the eight day
long, 2012 early voting period. \footnote{Locations where two or fewer
  individuals had recorded votes were dropped from our analysis.  The
  EViD data from Orange County and Palm Beach County in 2012 and 2016,
  from Miami-Dade County in 2016, and from Broward County in 2016 was
  not accompanied with voting locations for each early voter.  To
  determine the location at which these voters case their ballots, we
  match their voterids to a masterfile in Florida that records the
  location of every vote.}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2012} describes by day of early voting and by
hourly window the number of locations across our six counties that
actively served voters.  All locations served early voters virtually
the entire day, and this is evident in the flat line, for the most
part pegged a bit under 80 prior to 7:00pm, at the top of the figure;
the sole exception occurred at the earliest time of the day, during
which a few early voting stations did not have any active voters.

After 7:00pm, however, Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2012} shows that check-in
uniformity across locations quickly changed.  On early days within
Florida's eight-day long early voting period, there was a steep drop
in active voting locations starting at 7:00pm; note the vertical red
line at this time.  Even with this drop, however, there were still at
least five open locations at 9:00pm on every day of early voting in
the early voting period.  Then, on the last two days of early voting,
November 2 and 3, many early voting locations were open well beyond
7:00pm.  On the final Saturday of early voting, over 30 locations were
still open at 9:00pm, and several locations were continuing to process
voters at midnight.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hist2012} displays the total number of voters who
voted early by the hour of the day at which they checked-in. Prior to
7:00pm, voters check-ins were distributed fairly uniformly across the
day with a small peak before noon.  From 7:00am to 7:00pm, our
aggregated six counties consistently served approximately 70,000
voters per hour. Then, after 7:00pm, at which point new voters could
not join voting lines, the number of voters served per hour dropped
drastically but not entirely.  A total of 83,278 (8.8\%) early voters
in 2012 across the six counties cast ballots after 7:00pm. These are individuals who were in
line at the time the polls closed and were allowed to continue to wait
to vote.  We know that all of these voters had to wait in this way
although we do not know precisely how long each waited.  Of this
group, 36,148 voted after 8:00pm.  These voters waited at least one
hour to vote, and 13,595 voters, who checked-in after 9:00pm, must
have waited at least two hours to vote.

Aggregating across locations, Figure \ref{fig:race2012} describes the
composition of the 2012 early voting pool by race/ethnicity and by hour of
check-in.  For most of the day, whites were the majority racial group,
followed by blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.  This ranking is similar
to, but does not mirror, Florida's registered voter pool.  In the
Florida voter file as of December, 2012, which contains 12,580,602
individuals, approximately 66.4 percent are white, 13.9 percent
Hispanic, 13.6 percent black, and 1.63 percent Asian.  As in years
prior, blacks in Florida in 2012 were disproportionate users of the
state's early voting period \citep{herronsmith:souls}.

What is striking in Figure \ref{fig:race2012}, however, is the racial/ethnic
composition of the early voting pool immediately before and then after
7:00pm.  Simply put, the pool becomes rapidly non-white starting
around 7:00pm and by the 8:00pm-9:00pm window is less than 25 percent
white.

    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{partisan_composition_by_race.pdf}
\end{figure}

The party registration of the early voting pool varies slightly with time
although not nearly as starkly as its racial/ethnic composition.  Evolution
in party registration is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:party2012}, which
describes by early voting hour the partisan breakdown of all early
voters in our six counties as well as the party breakdown of the
four aforementioned racial/ethnic groups.  We plot party registration as the percent of early voters in
each hour of check-in who are registered Democrats.  While Democrats
made up 54\% of all those who voted early in our set of Florida
counties, we can see from the black line in the figure that this
percentage varied by hour of the day.  Notably, Democrats composed a
greater share of the voters in both the early hours of voting and the
hours after 7:00pm.  Hence, Democrats were disproportionately affected
by voting lines that forced voters to cast their ballots after 7:00pm.

%  XXX Need to check 54% figure above.

If we consider the breakdown of party registration by race/ethnicity,
as in in Figure \ref{fig:party2012}, we can see how this effect might
largely be due to the aforementioned racial/ethnic patterns of voting.
For example, black early voters in Florida were almost entirely
Democratic, regardless of when they checked-in to vote.  Similarly,
the party registration of Hispanic voters---the least Democratic group
in the six counties---remained relatively constant throughout the day.
However we do see a slight trend for white and Asian early voters, who
became increasingly likely to be registered as Democrats as time
progressed.

\subsubsection*{Early voting in 2016}

We now turn to early voting in 2016.  By the General Election in 2016,
Florida had increased the number of early voting days from eight to
14, ostensibly in an effort to reduce congestion. Was this change
effective?  Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is analogous to the earlier
figure that described active early voting locations.  Here we have
data from the same counties as in 2012.  These six counties had 104
early voting stations in place for the 2016 General Election.

% > length(unique(evid16$location))

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    Election}
  \label{fig:nrlocs2016}
  \centering
    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{number_of_locations_2016.pdf}
\end{figure}

Compared to its 2012 version, the most important aspect of Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is the pictured dropoff in voter check-ins that
occurred after 7:00pm.  There were indeed check-ins that took place
after this time but not nearly as many as in 2012.  On the busiest day
in 2012, more than half of the polling locations were open past 9:00pm
and more than five were open past midnight.  On the busiest day in
2016, though, only six locations were open past 9:00pm and not one
early voter cast a ballot after 10:00pm.  In the introduction we
commented on improvements in voter wait times that others have found
in 2016 compared to 2012, and Figure \ref{fig:nrlocs2016} is
consistent with national, survey-based findings on voter waiting.
Early voting in 2016---at least in the six Florida counties---appears
to represent a major improvement over 2012 in terms of reducing
congestion, which is presumably tied not only to the expanded number
of sites but also to the number of days and hours of operation during
which voters could cast an early ballot.\footnote{We use the verb
  ``appears'' here because of voting-level sorting that may affect
  with individuals cast their ballots.  When the Florida state
  legislature changed the state's early voting period between 2012 and
  2016, voters may have altered their most preferred voting times.}

\subsubsection*{Late voting in 2012 versus 2016}

Figure \ref{fig:race2012and2016} provides a race/ethnicity-based
perspective on the 2012 versus 2016 comparison for our six counties.
For three key racical/ethnic groups in Florida, black, Hispanic, and
white, the figure shows the total number of check-ins by time,
aggregated across all days in the 2012 and 2016 early voting periods.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \caption{Distribution of voter check-ins, 2012 General Election versus 2016 General Election}
  \label{fig:race2012and2016}
  \centering
  \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{histogram_by_hour_by_race_2012_2016.pdf}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:race2012and2016} shows clearly that, not only did more
voters check-in for early voting in 2016 compared to 2012, but fewer
voters voted past 7:00pm.  This is the case for black, Hispanic, and
white voters. Moreover, non-white early voters in Florida had
disproportionately late check-ins in 2012.  We already have seen
evidence of this, but Figure \ref{fig:race2012and2016} shows as well
how this problem did not appear in 2016.  There were slightly more
non-whites with late check-ins in 2016, but the magnitude of the white
versus non-white gap shrunk between the two years.

Even though 2016 attracted far more early voters than 2012, the
changes made to the early voting period appears to have reduced the
congestion outside of the polls. The increased number of days and hours may have helped,
as these six counties still served roughly the same number of early
voters per day in 2016 (approximately 120,521) as they did in 2012
(approximately 117,774).  Given reduced prevalence of lines in 2016, it
is likely that these and other reforms made the difference for congestion.

\subsection*{Effects of waiting to vote}

We now consider the effects on future political participation of
waiting in line to vote, in particular waiting in an early voting line
in the 2012 General Election.  The future participation we have in
mind is voting in the 2016 General Election.

We have already noted that the individual-level EViD files we have
include Florida voter identification numbers, and this enables us to
link these files with statewide Florida voter files.  These latter
files specify the elections in which voters participated and, if so,
whether they voted absentee, early in-person, or on Election Day.  Thus, for any
early voter in 2012 we can determine whether the individual voted in
the 2016 General Election, assuming that this individual still lived
in Florida as of November, 2016.\footnote{When a registered voter
  moves within Florida, the voter maintains the same voter
  identification number.  Our estimates in this section are thus not
  confounded by the possibility of 2012 early voters moving across
  county lines within Florida, for example.}  

The difficulty in our exercise here is twofold.  First, while we know
voter check-in times from our EViD data, we do not know associated
voter wait times \emph{per se}.  To determine wait times precisely we
would have to know early voter arrival times, which are not collected
by election officials.  Hence, distinguishing those early voters in
2012 who waited in line from those who did not is a challenge and
requires an alternative method along with some assumptions.  Second,
early voters who voted at, say, 9:00am on a given day of early voting
may be systematically different from those who voted at
6:00pm. Consequently, estimating the effect of voting after closing
time---when we know voters have waited in line---is potentially
confounded by voter-level selection effects.  Hence, we need to ensure
that we control for differences across early voters as best as we can
so that voter selection into time of early voting does not confound
our estimates of the effect of waiting on future participation.

Our approach is as follows.  We condition on race/ethnicity,
partisanship (as before, measured by party registration), gender, age,
and previous voting history.  And, we make the following assumption:
those who voted at early voting locations which stayed open well past
the 7:00pm cutoff time are more likely to have waited in line than
those who voted in voting locations that closed before 7:00pm or at
this time exactly.  Moreover, we assume that those who voted just
before the 7:00pm cutoff in early voting locations that stayed open
late are more likely to have waited in line than those who voted
earlier in the day.  We cannot know for sure if these assumptions
hold, but there is reason to believe that it does.

Take, for example, the two polling locations in Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2012}.  The first location---the Fred B.\ Karl County
Center in Hillsborough County---closed on time on November 3,
2012. That is to say, voters in this center voted up to, but not
beyond, 7:00pm.  Therefore, we assume that the Karl Center was not a
congested polling location and that the voters who voted just before
7:00pm did not have to wait in much of a line.  If they did have to
wait in line to vote, then the line remarkably stopped just in time
for the final early voter to check-in right before 7:00pm.  While this
is technically possible, it would be remarkably coincidental.

On the other hand, the second location in Figure
\ref{fig:nrlocs2012}---the West Kendall Regional Library in Miami-Dade
County---remained open until the last early voter checked-in around
1:00am on November 3.  We know with certainty that this last voter
waited in line to vote.  In fact, because all voters had to arrive
before 7:00pm in order to check-in, we know with certainty that he or
she waited at least six hours to vote.  Moreover, we can be fairly
confident that the voters who voted just before 7:00pm here also
waited in line.  Voting that continues past 7:00pm is indicative of a
polling place that was operating essentially at capacity at 7:00pm.
Hence, those voters who voted just before 7:00pm are similarly likely
to have been caught up in a long voting line.

With the above assumptions as background, our strategy for
distinguishing voters who waited in line from voters who did not wait
in line is first to distinguish those who voted in an an early voting polling place
that closed well past 7:00pm from those who voted in a polling place
that closed on time.  In other words, we attempt to compare voters who
cast their ballots in places like the Fred B.\ Karl County Center to
voters who voted in places like the West Kendall Regional Library.
More specifically, we want to compare those individuals who voted
closest to the 7:00pm cutoff, since those are the individuals who we
are most confident were affected by the congestion that caused polling
locations to close late.
 
Therefore, we identify all early voters who voted at a polling
location on a day where the last voter checked-in past 7:30pm.  These
are voters who cast ballots at locations where we know the line at the
end of the day was at least a half-hour long.  In what follows we call
this variable \emph{Over}.  Conditioning on race/ethnicity, partisanship,
gender, age, and previous voting record (whether the voter voted in
the 2008 election) we estimate the effect of voting at a polling
location that is congested in 2012---one that goes ``over''
7:30pm---on the probability of voting in 2016.  We employ a logistic
regression as follows:

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textup{Pr}\left(\mathrm{Voted16}_{i} = yes\right) =  \textup{logit}^{-1}&(\beta + \alpha_{Over} + \gamma_{Hour} +
    \sigma_{Over \times Hour} + \upsilon_{Gender}  + \\& \rho_{Race/Ethnicity} +
      \tau_{Age Group} + \psi_{Party} + \pi_{Voted\emph{08}})
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

In the above model, $i$ denotes our collection of 2012 early voters
who appear in the history of Florida voting in 2008; $Hour$ indicates
the hour of the day at which each voter checked-in, between 7:00am and
7:00pm; $Gender$ indicates whether the voter identifies as male or
female; $Race/Ethnicity$ indicates if the voter self-identifies as white, black,
Hispanic, or Asian; $AgeGroup$ classifies voters according to their
2016 age and bins them into 10-year age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49,
50-59, 60-69, and 70+); and, $Voted08$ and $Voted16$ are indicators
for participation in the 2008 and 2016 General Elections.  All told we
estimate our logistic regression based on 709,956 individuals, and
coefficient estimates appear in Table \ref{tab:reg} in the appendix.

Regression results are displayed graphically in Figure
\ref{fig:prvoting2016}. In this figure, we have estimated the
probability of voting in 2016 for a male Floridian who is 50 years
old, black, registered Democratic, and who also voted in 2008.  The
estimates are conditioned on each hour of the early voting day in
2012. The black points in the figure are the estimated probabilities
of voting in 2016 conditional on voting at a polling location that
closed before 7:30pm.  Based on our discussion above, these estimates
reflect individuals who likely did not wait in line.  The grey points
are the estimated probabilities of voting in 2016 conditional on
casting an early ballot at a polling location that closed \emph{after}
7:30pm.  These estimates reflect individuals who likely did wait in
line to vote.  Hence, the difference between these two sets of
estimates should reflect the effect of waiting in line.  Moreover, the
effect should be most isolated as one compares voters casting ballots
closer to 7:00pm.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\caption{Probability of voting in 2016, given 2012 check-in time}

  \centering
    \centering\includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{probability_of_voting_in_2016_over_under.pdf}
\end{figure}

One can see that, beginning at around 2:00pm, there is a small albeit
negative difference between those who voted in congested polling
places compared to those in non-congested polling places.  This might
suggest that the lines started in the early afternoon and this is why
a difference is induced so early.  Hence, the reason there is no
difference between congested and non-congested polling places earlier
in the day might be because lines have yet to form. As congested
polling places become congested in the afternoon, we begin to see the
small but significant effect on future participation.  This result
suggests that voting lines have a negative effect on future
participation.  However, the effect is very small, amounting to no
more than a percentage point difference in turnout.  Our results are
similar to those in \citet{pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}.

\section*{Conclusion}

The presence of lengthy voting lines in recent United States General
Elections has been of concern to scholars of election
administration. Burdensome wait times not only impose opportunity
costs on those forced to wait in line, but they might also discourage
future electoral participation.  This has encouraged researchers to
study the prevalence of long lines with an eye on who is forced to
wait in them and the extent to which the burden of waiting might
affect future turnout.

Research on voting lines, however, is challenged by the lack of data
on lines and wait times.  Other than noting the times at which polls
officially closed and recording information about voters who voted
late, there is little data collected by election officials that might
distinguish between those who waited in line to vote from those who
did not.  Notwithstanding a small number of exceptions, nor are there
official records on how long voters waited.  Previous research using
election records to study lines have thus been limited to examining
variables like aggregate precinct results
\citep[e.g.,][]{herronsmith:closingtimes,
  pettigrew:longlinesminorityprecincts}.  Data limitations have
prevented these projects from identifying individuals who waited in
line from those who did not \emph{within} the same precinct.

To overcome a lack of data that idenfies who waits in line to vote,
scholars have relied on surveys that ask respondents to recall their
experience at the polls and report the length of time that they waited
to vote \citep{stewart:waitingtovote2012, pettigrew:racegapwaittimes}.
While these survey-based analyses have illuminated important variation
in wait times across geographies and across racial/ethnic groups,
associated with them is the caveat that survey responses are subject
to biases associated with self-reporting and are limited in sample
size.

With these points in mind, we add to the literature on voting lines by
analyzing a new data set on early voter check-in times in Florida's
2012 and 2016 General Elections. Using electronic voting check-in data
from Alachua, Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, and Palm
Beach Counties, we are able to identify the exact day and time at
which thousands of voters checked-in to vote.  These check-in times
not only provide novel insight into voting patterns across time but
also allows us to identify individual voters who likely waited in line
to vote.

We have shown that Florida's early voting period in 2012 had a
significant number of voters who voted past the official 7:00pm
closing time and, therefore, must have waited in line to vote.  These
voters were disproportionately black, Hispanic, and Democrat---a
finding that coincides with survey results in prior studies of voting
lines.  In 2016, we find that congestion observed in 2012 had all but
vanished.  Voters rarely voted late into the night in 2016, and most
early voting locations in our Florida counties of interest closed on
time.  Even though the counties we study in 2016 served as many
individual per day as they had in 2012, they appear to have been more
prepared to handle the high rates of early voting.
  
We estimated the effect that waiting in line has on future
participation.  Using temporal variation in voting across polling
locations, we found a very slight negative effect on participation,
amounting to no more than a one percentage point decrease in the
propensity to vote. The result is similar to that identified by
\citet{pettigrew:racegapwaittimes}.

Except for the few states that require voters to cast ballots by mail
(or use drop off boxes), waiting to vote at the polls is likely to
continue to be an inevitable part of the voting experience for voters
in certain jurisdictions. Long lines may result in some voters not
only having to pay a time tax, but they may also serve as a deterrent
on future voting for some citizens. In Florida, the expansion of the
number of days, hours, and locations of early voting between the 2012
and 2016 General Elections likley helped to alleviate some of the
dealys experienced by those voters who chose to voter during the early
voting period, especially those casting ballots late in the day.
Further research needs to be conducted on how such delays at the polls
may affect future turnout decisions.
