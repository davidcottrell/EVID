\noindent This memorandum describes changes we have made to our
manuscript in light of a referee report. We very much appreciate the
thoughtful feedback provided to us and the opportunity to submit a
revision of our manuscript.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{I will commend the authors: it is a rare joy in reviewing
    manuscripts to find an ms that when I ask a question, the answer
    is provided in the next paragraph just about every time. It was
    that way with this one. The literature review does a fair and good
    job placing the study amongst the voter survey literature and then
    discussing the contributions, assumptions, and limitations of this
    work. This work is not oversold and/or held up as a panacea as so
    many ms's are these days. Thank you for that.}  We very much
  appreciate the referee's positive reaction to our manuscript and
  hope that our revision is even better.

\item \emph{I might have done a couple of things differently on county
    selection--namely including a few more to get a more diverse set
    (e.g., on the urban vs. rural and perhaps more v. less educated
    front instead of maximizing for population).}  We appreciate being
  pushed in this direction and have again reached out to counties to
  try to get more data.  We were able to add four counties to our
  list: Hernando, Levy, Osceola, and Putnam.  Both Levy and Putnam are
  rural, which we point out in the revised manuscript.  In terms of
  education, Alachua County, which was in the initial submission, is
  home to the University of Florida.  XXX Dan, say something else
  about education?


\item \emph{There's a *lot* of descriptive evidence/results in this
    paper. I find that valuable, and just about each piece of evidence
    is interesting and needed to get to an understanding of what's
    going on. I only mention this because obviously it adds length,
    and I'm sure the editors might think about encouraging the authors
    to put at least some of this into an appendix. I think the flow is
    pretty good as it is, but space is always a concern.}  We agree.
  We have cut twoXXX pages from the initial submission, and the
  revision is now XXX total pages.  We are happy to move some material
  to an appendix but are hopeful that the slightly shorter revision
  will make that unnecessary.
\end{itemize}

With regard to the data and choices made about research design and measurement, I really didn't have many concerns and I thought the authors' choices made sense. I do have to wonder if different measurement choices would have affected the results, but I can't really throw cold water on the ms for the decisions the authors made. 

I might have done a couple of things differently on county selection--namely including a few more to get a more diverse set (e.g., on the urban vs. rural and perhaps more v. less educated front instead of maximizing for population). However, I also am always cautious of being that reviewer who asks for "more." I understand why the authors chose this path and am not thinking the selection affects the results in systemic fashion--I'm merely throwing out an hypothesis and I only mention it as a potential bias that the authors may want to talk about/think about a bit more.  


More importantly, the inferences drawn from these results prior to the regressions are valid, which leads up to the logits which are on-point and well-specified, and the inferences and conclusions drawn from them make sense. 

It's a neat paper that uses interesting data to augment our understanding of a political phenomenon. I am going to suggest an R&R to the editors; best of luck to you.
