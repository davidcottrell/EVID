		The existence of voting lines is a major concern \ldots
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[1.]<1-> Opportunity costs - essentially a time tax {\tiny (Mukherjee 2009)}
				\item[2.]<1-> Downstream consequences  {\tiny (Pettigrew 2017)}\\~\\
			\end{itemize} 
		We want to know \dots
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[1.]<1-> Who bears the burden of this tax? Is it fairly distributed?
				\item[2.]<1-> Does waiting in line
                                  discourage future participation?  Or
                                  possible encourage future participation?

          Challenge: data availability

          \item<2-> Need to identify those who waited in line, their characteristics, AND link them to future behavior data availability.\\~\\
          \end{itemize}
          Scholars of lines have relied on two sources:
          \begin{itemize}
				\item[1.]<3-> Election Day exit polls or post-election surveys (SPAE, CCES) {\tiny (Stewart 2013 and 2015)}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item<3-> {\small 10\% of voters waited longer than 30 minutes in 2012}
						\item<3-> {\small Limitation: self-reporting and social desirability bias}
					\end{itemize}
				\item[2.]<4> Closing times of polling location and aggregate demographic data {\tiny (Herron and Smith 2014; Pettigrew 2016)}
					\begin{itemize}
						\item<4-> {\small Waiting in line reduced voter turnout by 1\%}
						\item<4-> {\small Limitation: aggregate data and ecological fallacy}

	\section{Data}
	\subsection{About the data}
		\begin{frame}
                  We turn to a unique data source produced by Electronic Voter iDentification (EViD) machines during the early voting period for Florida's general election. 
		 	\begin{itemize}
				\item<2-> Voters can cast their ballots at any polling location within a county during early voting in Florida.
				\item<2-> EViD machines allow pollworkers to check-in and verify registration statuses electronically, then synchronize across locations.
				\item<2-> Used to thwart double
                                  voting.
				\item<3-> Early voting is distinct in
                                  some ways from Election Day voting.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{frame}
		
		\begin{frame}
		EViD data:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item<2->Timestamps of individual votes during early voting period in General Elections in 2012 and 2016.
				\item<2->6 counties in Florida: Alachua, Broward, Hillsborough,  Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach.
				\item<2->8 days, 78 locations, and 942,194 early voters in 2012.
				\item<2->14 days, 104 locations, and 1,687,304 early voters in 2016.
			\end{itemize}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item<3->[] Polls open at 7am and close at 7pm.  Anyone in line before 7pm can vote.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item This is key!! We know
                                          that anyone who voted past
                                          7pm waited to voted.
				\end{itemize} 
			\end{itemize} 
		\end{frame}
			
		\begin{frame}
		Pros of EVID data
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[1.]  We can leverage closing times to identify individuals who waited in line to vote during early voting in 2012. 
				\item[2.]  Individual voters can be linked to the Florida voter file, including
                                  \begin{itemize}
                                  \item  demographic characteristics (voter extract). 
                                  \item  prior and subsequent voting behavior (voter history). 
                                  \end{itemize}
                                \end{itemize}
		Cons
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[1.] Does not identify arrival time for those who voted.
				\item[2.] Does not identify
                                  individuals who left before voting.
				\item[3.] And does not identify
                                  individuals who were deterred by an
                                  existing line.

		\section{Conclusion}
	
		\begin{frame}
			Conclusion
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[1.] Voting lines were in some location in Florida were severe in 2012.  Line length improved in 2016.
				\item[2.] Certain voters (specifically minorities and Democrats) are more likely to be affected by long wait times. 
				\item[3.] Holding all else constant, waiting in line results in about a 1\% decrease in turnout.
